Nerd alert.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>It's funny you know, I have this amazing gaming PC at home (my work machine on the other hand is a Mac) and despite it being able to put my xbox 360 to shame I find myself regularly loading up a 2D based RPG released almost 4 years ago by a legendary, though now defunct studio. What has me playing Icewind Dale 2 instead of Oblivion (which is a great game that I still haven't finished)? Party-based gameplay, best of genre strategic combat and the most varied character creation of any game ever released. Years later I still can sit for hours thinking up clever names and picking portrais for my sad band of pixelated hereos.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>I remember seeing Greg give it an 8.3 all those years ago and completely agreeing with the score. It was a great game, but there was virtually no story and even then its Infinity Engine graphics were below par for the time. Neverwinter Nights was released around the same time and IWD2 was seen by the press as this last gasp funeral for people that just couldn't let go of games like Baldur's Gate. NWN and Bioware were supposedly taking us to the future of RPG gaming that would bring the genre to the mainstream. Little did we know that it would be another old-time stuido, Bethesda, that would usher us into that new era with Morrowind and Bioware would start making neutered Star Wars games.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>Since 2002 I have played Morrowind twice, NWN and it's expansions once and Icewind Dale II six times. I have played virtually every single-player PC RPG released in the past 4 years and found that nothing comes close to IWD2's depth or fun factor. Somehow this old \\\"8.3\\\" game has provided enough replayability for me to load it up year after year and take a party of 4 to 6 characters (with silly names like \\\"Kelgar\\\", \\\"Dash\\\" and \\\"Vicor\\\") across a bloodied tundra of 40 hours of non-stop fighting.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>At this point I've figured out why I love IWD2 so much and why I've continue to come back to it. The game is both very hard and very fair at the same time. Unlike most hard games you don't feel like the game is cheating you or unfairly assisting its monsters in some way. When you lose in IWD2, you lose because you made a mistake or you weren't thinking about how to attack a situation. This is true regardless of your party's composition, and because of that it is always fun to play. Of the six times I've played it through, I've had a completely different party that needed to utilize different strategies to get through the same difficult scenarios. I've died dozens of times on the famous \\\"bridge fight\\\", a battle that finds you flanked on both sides, running out of spells midway through the fight and relying on some clever positioning to keep all your characters alive.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>The best way that I can describe the variety of combat to someone who is used to RPGs, but may not have played IWD2 per se is that in IWD2 your most powerful spells have nothing to do with damage. Although there are a lot of RPGs out there that give you lots of spells most of them end up being worthless; you end up just spamming the high damage spell trying to kill a single character. Not so in IWD2, your most powerful spells are things like sleep, color spray, grease and ray of enfeablement. While you'll use that fireball at some point, it's only after you've neutralized your enemy that you'll even bother to attack them.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>Why is this strategy (which is super fun and stressful) so common in IWD2 but not other games of its type? Simply because in this game its not uncommon to fight over a dozen enemies at a time. If you tried to just attack them you'd be overwhelmed. Unlike Oblivion you can't just run around the arena with your shield up casting fireballs at those 2-3 powerful guys, there's no where to run in this game, the enemies are coming at you in large numbers and there's nothing you can do about it but lay down some debuff spells, hold that holds half of them off and then concentrate your damage at what is now a pretty fair fight.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>The tension and skill you find that comes out of these types of battles is intense, and because your party is always so different with each new game, your way of combatting the situation will always change.<\\/div><div><br\\/><\\/div><div>It's a hell of a ride and one I will likely return to again next year. If you aren't afraid of a challenge and don't mind looking at a bunch of sprites I highly recommend you check it out. That 8.3 might have been true for its time, but like a good wine, Icewind Dale 2 has aged quite well.<\\/div>\",\"guid\":\"2200-6\",\"id\":6,\"reviewer\":\"snide\",\"score\":5,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/icewind-dale-ii\\/3030-8890\\/user-reviews\\/2200-6\\/\",\"wikiObject\":\"Icewind Dale II (Collector's Edition)\",\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-8890\\/\",\"id\":8890,\"name\":\"Icewind Dale II\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/icewind-dale-ii\\/3030-8890\\/\"},\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-3331\\/\",\"id\":3331,\"name\":\"Icewind Dale II (Collector's Edition)\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/icewind-dale-ii\\/3030-8890\\/release\\/3050-3331\\/\"},\"dlc\":null},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/user_review\\/2200-7\\/\",\"date_added\":\"2008-07-21 00:34:06\",\"date_last_updated\":\"2012-04-15 14:07:11\",\"deck\":\"Simple But Fun\",\"description\":\"<p>There\\u2019s something to be said for single-minded purpose in game design. Gauntlet Legends is a perfect example to be used in the argument, no matter on which side you might be. It\\u2019s an unapologetic dungeon crawler. You hack. You slash. You level up. It doesn\\u2019t aspire to do anything more. It may not do a whole lot but don\\u2019t take that to mean it\\u2019s not worth playing. It does what little it does do very well and if you\\u2019re looking for a hack-and-slash RPG in the classic sense, this would be a fine choice - especially if you have some friends wanting to join.<br\\/><br\\/>Gauntlet Legends is revolves around the story of a big bad demon named Skorne, who was summoned by an eager young mage long ago but then turned on his new master and spread 13 runes across\\u2026ah, who cares? The story in Gauntlet Legends serves no purpose other than to provide you with a bad guy to fight at the end and a bunch of little bad guys to fight along the way. You fight those bad guys in four different worlds with about 5-7 stages in each world. Each of the worlds is certainly distinct from one another but the stages within those worlds tend to bleed together.<br\\/><br\\/>You fight as one of the four characters from the original Gauntlet: the warrior, archer, valkyrie, and wizard. There really isn\\u2019t much of a difference between them, though. Each plays about the same way with main variance between them being how the characters\\u2019 attacks look. They also have slight stat difference but too slight to make a difference. The highlight of each character is their power attacks - devastating attacks that recharge as you play. These impressive attacks annihilate everything on screen (and off-screen if you\\u2019re lucky) with matching visual flair. A number of items spice up combat instead of a variety of moves. There are amulets to strengthen basic attacks, multi-shot items to proliferate your ranged attacks, and hourglasses to stop time. The items are a blast to use and who doesn\\u2019t like growing huge like Apache Chief and obliterating some dudes?<br\\/><br\\/>Legends looks alright but it\\u2019s nothing special. The aforementioned power attacks look fittingly impressive but can cause some slow-down when used if the screen is filled with enemies. The catch is that the attacks are most often used when the screen is full of enemies. Oh well, can\\u2019t have everything I guess. Some environment textures can be pretty blurry as well but the player characters are better detailed.<br\\/><br\\/>And with Gauntlet Legends, the more of those characters being used, the better. This game thrives on co-op play. The arcade roots of the game have obviously remained intact on the transfer to consoles. It\\u2019s at its best when you\\u2019re stomping through a few levels full of demons with three of your buddies.<br\\/>What\\u2019s on display with Gauntlet Legends might seem too simplified for some, but that really is the game\\u2019s strength. It\\u2019s single-minded, it knows it, and it does well the one thing it sets out to do. It doesn\\u2019t bring anything new to the dungeon crawler but that\\u2019s not a bad thing in this instance. It\\u2019s a great example of the genre and easily recommendable to anyone looking to knock around zombies, lizards, and skeletons with some friends.<br\\/><br\\/><\\/p>\",\"guid\":\"2200-7\",\"id\":7,\"reviewer\":\"joseppie\",\"score\":4,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/gauntlet-legends\\/3030-12245\\/user-reviews\\/2200-7\\/\",\"wikiObject\":\"Gauntlet Legends\",\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-12245\\/\",\"id\":12245,\"name\":\"Gauntlet Legends\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/gauntlet-legends\\/3030-12245\\/\"},\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-77767\\/\",\"id\":77767,\"name\":\"Gauntlet Legends\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/gauntlet-legends\\/3030-12245\\/release\\/3050-77767\\/\"},\"dlc\":null},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/user_review\\/2200-8\\/\",\"date_added\":\"2008-07-21 00:36:10\",\"date_last_updated\":\"2014-01-03 00:35:49\",\"deck\":\"The Best Around (Still)\",\"description\":\"<p>The last and best of the MVP Baseball Series, MVP 2005 represents a spit-shine of the franchise. Due to the Take-Two third-party exclusivity agreement with the MLB, EA\\u2019s brand of baseball ends with this installment. It\\u2019s a shame really. Growing out of the Triple Play series, MVP has come to represent some of the best in simulation baseball. <br\\/><br\\/>The main new features for this installment are Owner\\u2019s Mode, mini-games, and Hitter\\u2019s Eye. Hitter\\u2019s Eye is a system to tell what kind of pitch is being thrown before the ball actually leaves the pitcher\\u2019s hand. This is done through the ball flashing different colors corresponding to a specific pitch, as in white for fastball, red for curveball, etc. Hitter\\u2019s Eye really doesn\\u2019t have much of an effect on the gameplay, however. It can occasionally offer a good tip while on offense but I often found myself paying little to no attention to it. <br\\/><br\\/>Owner\\u2019s Mode is an addition that fans of the series have been clamoring for since 2003. Its absence from MVP 2004 was certainly conspicuous due to the inclusion of similar modes in other EA Sports titles, like Madden 2004. Owner\\u2019s Mode gives complete control of an organization to the player by allowing them to build their own stadium, hire\\/fire staff, set ticket and concession prices, run promotional giveaways, and other decisions that the suits behind baseball teams make. All of this is stacked on top of the existing Dynasty Mode framework, resulting in an exceptionally deep season mode. It\\u2019s also fun on top of being deep. Building your team and making money (even if it\\u2019s fake) becomes very satisfying and addicting. The mode can become entrenched in micro managing, however, resulting in too much time navigating menus and not enough time on the field. Also, beginning with a major league team in a minor league ballpark is just kind of weird.<br\\/><br\\/>The mini-games may seem, at first glance, to be a throwaway addition. In fact, they contain some of the most fun to be had in MVP 2005. The batting mini-game consists of a field with various ramps and obstructions placed on it. You receive points based on the distance of your hits. On top of that, each pitch is delegated a certain part of the field to be hit to and, sometimes, a fly ball or ground ball trajectory. The pitching mini-game is basically a baseball version of Bejeweled. The strike zone is divided into a series of rectangles, each with a color. That color corresponds to a certain pitch and the player receives points for throwing the correct pitch in the right location, with larger groups of rectangles rewarding more points. The mini-game has timed and untimed varieties, of which the timed version is superior due to its gleefully frantic nature. Both of the mini-games offer a surprising amount of fun and can also affect gameplay by being used as stat-boosting activities during Spring Training of Dynasty\\/Owner mode.<br\\/><br\\/>Gameplay-wise, MVP 2005 doesn\\u2019t stray far at all from the 2004 iteration. This is a very good thing. The unparalleled amount of control given to the player previously still remains unparalleled.\\u00a0 Small tweaks have been made to pitching (a more forgiving pitch meter), baserunning (more difficult stolen bases), and hitting (the ability to move around in the box and the inclusion of foul tips), but the core game has remained intact. Pitching still consists of the golf swing meter used to determine pitch speed and accuracy. A small tweak has been made this year, however, by making the sweet spot of the meter slightly wider in order to be more forgiving. Hitting remains based on timing and the direction the analog stick is pushed. Fielding and baserunning keep the diamond-based button layout with throwing using a simplified swing meter. Everything adds up to result in some of the best gameplay conventions in the business. <br\\/><br\\/>Graphically, MVP 2005 looks excellent. The many player models look authentic. Star players each have individually modeled life-like faces with a number of generic, but still well done, faces filling in for everyone else. Player bodies, thankfully, look in line with reality with no players looking so pumped full of \\u2018roids they could explode. Stadiums, as well, look authentic with notable landmarks like the fountains of Kaufmann Stadium looking lovely. But animations are the star of the show when it comes to MVP 2005\\u2019s graphics. Everything benefits from the inclusion of thousands of new animations, particularly hitting and fielding. Hitters react realistically in the batter\\u2019s box following swings and foul tips. Instead of returning right back to their stances like some kind of batting robot, hitters will get mad at themselves after bad swings and mosey about after foul tips. Strikeouts are another showpiece for the animation, with appropriately dejected or angered reactions. Fielders have a wide range of ways to make plays on the diamond because of the variety of animations. Diving stops and leaping grabs? Yep. I\\u2019ll-get-to-it-when-I-feel-like-it plays? Yes\\u2019m. Sunday hops to infielders? Uh-huh. Each of these plays is then followed by an assortment of throwing animations. Game after game, you can still see new plays happening in the field. In short, the players move like baseball players are supposed to move.<br\\/><br\\/>In the audio department, all the sounds of baseball are present. EA Sports has done a wonderful job of capturing the atmosphere of the ballpark with everything from the hecklers to the hot dog vendors. On the field, the crack of the bat and the smack of the ball in the glove sound very genuine. The main knock against the audio presentation is the commentary. The duo of Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow do a passable job of play-by-play commentary but it\\u2019s nothing to write home about. Kupier reacts similarly to most plays, be it a single through the hole or an inside-the-parker. He remains relatively flat and unenthusiastic throughout. Krukow provides much needed contrast to Kuiper by offering some animated color commentary. Often he\\u2019ll get so excited that his voice even seems to break. Another gripe against the commentary, aside from Kuiper, is the repetition of phrases like \\u201cthis guy\\u201d or \\u201cthat player\\u201d instead of using player names. It begins to stick out like sore thumb after awhile.<br\\/><br\\/>MVP 2005 supports online play, as well, save for the GameCube version. There isn\\u2019t really much to say about it other than it\\u2019s online baseball. If that\\u2019s what you\\u2019re looking for, that\\u2019s what you\\u2019ll get; though, it does boast some nice features like custom rosters and tourneys. The quality of the online play really depends on the quality of your and your opponent\\u2019s connections. Bad connections can lead to borderline unplayable games and certainly not enjoyable ones.<br\\/><br\\/>MVP Baseball 2005 is one of the best baseball simulations around, even still to this day. Games since its time have looked prettier and flashier; none have played better.<\\/p>\",\"guid\":\"2200-8\",\"id\":8,\"reviewer\":\"joseppie\",\"score\":5,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/mvp-baseball-2005\\/3030-9978\\/user-reviews\\/2200-8\\/\",\"wikiObject\":\"MVP Baseball 2005\",\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-9978\\/\",\"id\":9978,\"name\":\"MVP Baseball 2005\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/mvp-baseball-2005\\/3030-9978\\/\"},\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-84958\\/\",\"id\":84958,\"name\":\"MVP Baseball 2005\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/mvp-baseball-2005\\/3030-9978\\/release\\/3050-84958\\/\"},\"dlc\":null},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/user_review\\/2200-9\\/\",\"date_added\":\"2008-07-21 00:44:42\",\"date_last_updated\":\"2010-04-10 17:32:38\",\"deck\":\"Thrills and Hilarity Ensue...\",\"description\":\"<p>Need for Speed: Most Wanted acts as an injection of freshness that the series needed after the Underground games. Those games, and other franchises, have stretched the tuner scene pretty thin. They also lacked any real police presence, a key feature of earlier series entries and an omission that didn\\u2019t do the games any favors. This latest iteration rectifies that mistake and puts a good foot forward for the new generation of consoles.<br\\/><br\\/>In Most Wanted, you play as a no-name racer in Rockport taking on the Blacklist, a collection of the 15 most notorious street racers in the city. The game starts off with you taking on Razor Callahan, who occupies the 15th spot. But it\\u2019s never a fair fight. Razor\\u2019s cronies mess with your car before the race causing you to not only lose the race, but lose your car and get arrested to boot. You\\u2019re back in the saddle soon enough, though, with help from a woman named Mia. \\u00a0<br\\/><br\\/>The incredible FMV cutscenes scattered throughout the game are also introduced at the beginning. These cutscenes aren\\u2019t incredible for their visual panache (though they do sport a cool look by combining live actors with CG backgrounds) but instead because of their performances. The acting on display here would put William Shatner to shame. The characters are so absolutely chomping down on the scenery that you can\\u2019t help but laugh. Whether it\\u2019s intentional or not, it\\u2019s still hilarious. However, most of the story is conveyed through text and voice messages from the various characters for the remainder of the game. These contain a good amount of hamming themselves; nevertheless, the cutscenes take the cake.<br\\/><br\\/>The game\\u2019s career mode sprawls out from there. You\\u2019re tasked with taking down Razor, and since he\\u2019s now #1 on the Blacklist, everyone else along the way. You accomplish this by beating each member of the Blacklist in races, but you first must prove yourself worthy to face them by completing a number of other challenges. These include driving game staples like circuit, sprint, drag, and knockout races. Checkpoint races are present in the form of tollbooth races and speed trap races place a number of radar guns around the track that clock your speed with the racer with the highest total combined speed at the end of the race winning.<br\\/><br\\/>Besides the races, you have to reach milestones involving the game\\u2019s biggest adversary \\u2013 the cops. These range from getting a set number of cops involved in a chase to accruing an overall bounty through various illegal acts. Police can get involved both during and outside of races. However, chases outside of races are where the real fun is. They begin small, with only a few squad cars, but as your heat level rises, the big guns get rolled out. Spike strips, roadblocks, helicopters, and federal Corvettes start bearing down on you. At this point, eluding them can get pretty complicated, requiring you to get and stay out of sight. Oftentimes, just when you think you\\u2019re safe, a patrol car will come screeching around the corner to blow your cover. It\\u2019s maddening and nerve-racking and thrilling all in one.<br\\/><br\\/>The core racing through which all this takes place, for the most part, is fun. The computer tends to keep races close by exhibiting some rubber band tendencies. However, this isn\\u2019t as detrimental to the game as it might initially seem. In fact, it accentuates the experience, especially when the police are involved. There\\u2019s more bumper-to-bumper racing in those situations than you\\u2019ll see in any driving game. But it can be annoying near the end of races when the computer immediately pounces on little mistakes, making you start the whole thing over again, but the trade-off is worth the gripes.<br\\/><br\\/>The graphics of Most Wanted go a long way to enhance the experience through detailed car models and a good sense of speed. The varied environments in the city of Rockport and flashing police lights reflect off car models in convincing fashion. But sometimes all the visual flash can be too much and causes the game to stutter. It\\u2019s not a huge problem but it certainly detracts from the visuals. The audio portion of the game is largely excellent. The aforementioned voice performances are great, at least depending on your viewpoint. Engine roars and tire squeals are high quality too. But the police chatter is, by far, the highlight. It makes you wonder if they just stuck a microphone up to a police scanner; it sounds that genuine. Meanwhile, the music that accompanies the gameplay is rather generic. A lot of hip-hop and rock with some techno mixed in for good measure plays in the background, but a decent chase-y theme kicks in when the fuzz get involved.<br\\/><br\\/>Need for Speed: Most Wanted doesn\\u2019t do everything perfectly. But it does most things very well. Especially the police sections, and that\\u2019s a good thing given that putting \\u201cMost Wanted\\u201d in the title without nailing the police chases would be inexcusable. All in all, this game offers more thrills than most racing titles and is certainly worth checking out.<br\\/><br\\/><\\/p>\",\"guid\":\"2200-9\",\"id\":9,\"reviewer\":\"joseppie\",\"score\":4,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/need-for-speed-most-wanted\\/3030-12976\\/user-reviews\\/2200-9\\/\",\"wikiObject\":\"Need for Speed: Most Wanted\",\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-12976\\/\",\"id\":12976,\"name\":\"Need for Speed: Most Wanted\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/need-for-speed-most-wanted\\/3030-12976\\/\"},\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-88239\\/\",\"id\":88239,\"name\":\"Need for Speed: Most Wanted\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/need-for-speed-most-wanted\\/3030-12976\\/release\\/3050-88239\\/\"},\"dlc\":null},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/user_review\\/2200-10\\/\",\"date_added\":\"2008-07-21 00:49:38\",\"date_last_updated\":\"2010-05-12 14:35:20\",\"deck\":\"To call this game amazing would be a gross understatement\",\"description\":\"<p>Grand Theft Auto in my eyes is one of the best game series of all time and is destined to be a classic remembered twenty years down the road and beyond. It was to my great joy that Grand Theft Auto IV was hinted at some three years ago and what a journey has it been. Thankfully on Tuesday, April 29th 2008 the game I waited oh so long for finally came out after a couple of mind numbingly annoying delays. I had huge expectations from this game as it garnered the first 10 from Gamespot and IGN in a decade and had critical acclaim from media outlets that had previously bashed it. Let me just say that my expectations of an amazing game were not just met but were shattered. This truly is the best Grand Theft Auto game of all time and it truly earns the first perfect review I have given. <br\\/> Let's start off with one of the highlights of GTA IV, the wonderful graphics. I have never been so amazed by a games graphics in all my life. This game literally was the first game to make me say, \\\"Wow\\\" when I first feasted my eyes upon it. The game has some very technologically proficient graphics courtesy of the RAGE engine upon which it is based. For the first time in GTA history the characters function as life like humans, each finger has its own motions, the characters express a variety of facial expressions, and the world is living and breathing. The water has also become beautiful in its own right and of course Liberty City is one of the most beautiful landscapes ever rendered into a game. The sheer amount of detail that was put into cars and civilians simply is amazing. The cars look in my opinion near life like and look as good as the cars in any racing game, and that's not even the main focus of the game. The car damage has been vastly improved as well to make it more realistic. The civilians and other people in the environment look just as great as Niko and I have yet to see the exact same person twice. The city is a living and breathing metropolis. Perhaps the most amazing graphical achievement I have seen in this game is the explosions and gunplay. Every bullet hole is seen on a wall and gunfights just look great. Shooting up cars now displays to you cracked window shields with blood in the cracks and it just looks good. The explosions are the highlight of the graphics in my opinion, each one is amazing and the smoke bellows and the fire send an inferno within a large radius. These truly are mind shattering explosions. The physics engine is really put to use, for instance blowing up a police car with five officers around it will send all the police flying in different directions flailing and screaming for their lives. It's just satisfying and brings a new sense of realism and is an amazing achievement in the game. <br\\/> As far as game play goes Grand Theft Auto IV has fixed and changed many things about the game, despite these changes though the game still has the unique feel of a Grand Theft Auto game and not something totally different. Perhaps the most important game play change to mention is the new and redone combat system. Apart from improved aiming Rockstar has also added in a cover system. All of this works very well and it's a blast to get into gunfights knowing the combat will be seamless and easy to get the hang of. I have never had a problem with combat though I understand some people have. I don't blame them for having these problems but I think what they complain about is trivial. The combat system still has slight room for improvement but it is much better this time around and I really had a lot of fun. The melee combat is also a lot different now as it is far more complex and deep but still a lot of fun. It has made the melee combat a lot more fun and a lot more brutal. Another excellent game play element is the cell phone which is probably the best new feature in the game. I absolutely love this thing; you can arrange dates with your friends, take pictures, play multiplayer, and take calls from mission givers. It's just a great feature and feels seamlessly integrated into the game. It doesn't feel tacked on but rather it feels as if it's always been apart of GTA. In a sense it has as cell-phones were used in the past in Vice City and San Andreas but never to this level of depth. The other new features in the game play are all great but somewhat negligible to mention as they don't add a lot to change the experience but certainly if you access them they make the game a blast. Some of these include being able to go to comedy clubs and cabaret clubs which are amazingly funny and entertaining. <br\\/> The sound of Grand theft Auto IV is top notch. The soundtrack in my opinion is amazing and Rockstar really did a good job of using licensed music in the cut scenes and to set mood. The radio stations are all great and I was happy to see Rockstar taking risks with the types of music they chose to put in. This soundtrack is my favorite yet as it didn't distract me like it did in previous Grand Theft Auto games but rather made me feel more into the game. It was also great to hear plenty of new music I never heard before. Unlike San Andreas or Vice City where I heard it all before Grand Theft Auto IV allowed me to hear plenty of new stuff that I surely enjoyed. The script is also top notch; the dialogue is snappy, smart, and funny. Niko is the most real character yet thanks to his dialogue and the other characters are brought to life through excellent writing and excellent voice work. One notable change in the voice work was no celebrities were brought in this time around unlike in other Grand Theft Auto games. This is a welcome change and I didn't miss them one bit, the voice actors in the game were amazing and I thought they did a better job then any of the Hollywood actors did in the past. The sound in the game is of the highest quality and should be a bar that all games should shoot for. <br\\/> Grand Theft Auto IV is in my opinion simply the best game ever made. Previous to it my favorite game of all time was Grand Theft Auto San Andreas but this game easily tops it. It highly deserves a ten score and all the critical acclaim it has garnered from various publications. Its value is excellent, the single player clocks in at around 50-60 hours with all the side missions you can do and the multiplayer lasts forever with 15 modes to play around with. This is a game I will have fun with for a long time and I am glad I bought it opening day. Paying 60 dollars for this game is a steal of a price as it is worth a ton more. Buying this game isn't a choice but rather an obligation at this point as this is quite possible the best game I have ever played, hears waiting for Rockstar's next entry into the Grand Theft Auto series. In the meantime I'll be playing Grand Theft Auto IV until my eyes fall out, simply outstanding from start to end.<\\/p>\",\"guid\":\"2200-10\",\"id\":10,\"reviewer\":\"toriko\",\"score\":5,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/grand-theft-auto-iv\\/3030-20457\\/user-reviews\\/2200-10\\/\",\"wikiObject\":\"Grand Theft Auto IV\",\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20457\\/\",\"id\":20457,\"name\":\"Grand Theft Auto IV\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/grand-theft-auto-iv\\/3030-20457\\/\"},\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-72362\\/\",\"id\":72362,\"name\":\"Grand Theft Auto IV\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/grand-theft-auto-iv\\/3030-20457\\/release\\/3050-72362\\/\"},\"dlc\":null},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/user_review\\/2200-11\\/\",\"date_added\":\"2008-07-21 00:51:31\",\"date_last_updated\":\"2009-11-30 14:22:53\",\"deck\":\"Metal Gear Solid 4 is a game that will leave you speechless\",\"description\":\"<p>Story: Your Solid snake or old snake which ever you wish.

Metal Gear Solid 4 continues this trend by not only reaching this goal, but by blasting it into hyper-space. But what hasn't been done well in a Metal Gear Solid game is a perfect control system, an in-depth and varied gameplay and intense action, to which Metal Gear Solid 4 not only improves upon these elements, but perfects them.<br\\/><br\\/>Snake's final chapter begins in the Middle East, and he is tasked with the extermination of Liquid. With nanomachines controlling and surpressing soldiers emotions, and Snake's curiously rapid aging, you know things are going to go horribly wrong from the beginning, which leads to Snake jetting off to South America, Europe and some other exotic and not-so-exotic locales. All loose ends get tied up in MGS4, such as the FoxDie virus, the mysterious Patriots and the fates of characters like Raiden, Rose, EVA, Vamp and Meryl Sliverburgh being some examples.<br\\/><br\\/>If you couldn't make sense of the above paragraph, then MGS4 is certainly not the game for you, as it has a convulted story that doesn't require you to have played previous games, but it sure helps a hell of a lot. Even with the fantastic gameplay, if you didn't like Metal Gear because of it's story before, then Metal Gear Solid 4 isn't going to change your mind.<br\\/><br\\/>But if you are one of the many that enjoys Metal Gear Solid for it's story, then the fantastic gameplay is no longer an optional extra. The gameplay is now an integral, exciting and, most importantly; fun part of the game. With new additions such as the Octocamo, a suit that changes it's colour and texture based on the surface Snake is pressed up against, and the Metal Gear Mk. II, sneaking around the environment has never been more fun.<br\\/><br\\/>But if you're the type of person to go in gun-ho, then you're not punished by it, and in some cases, rewarded for it. Not only does it offer a nice change of pace to sneaking, it can net you some Drebin Points (a form of currency used to buy and upgrade weapons) and you can ally yourself with the local militia, who are intent on taking down Liquid's private army.<br\\/><br\\/>All of this looks and sounds fantastic. War-torn buildings and gritty textures populate the Middle Eastern setting, lush jungle environments with towering trees and beautiful rivers reside in other countries. With the sound of bullets whizzing past Snake's head, pummeling explosions and heart-stopping gunshots, you'll need to remind yourself that you're not playing a movie.<br\\/><br\\/>MGS4 is one for the fans, but newcomers will find something they like. Although it has little replay value, and some may find Kojima's trademark humour a little tasteless, Metal Gear Solid 4 is an epic, action-packed, heart-pounding experience. Though there are some parts of the game that you are guaranteed to dislike, the clever boss battles, and some intense on-rails sequences will surely win you over. <\\/div>\",\"guid\":\"2200-12\",\"id\":12,\"reviewer\":\"microwavedapple\",\"score\":4,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\\/3030-20669\\/user-reviews\\/2200-12\\/\",\"wikiObject\":\"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (Limited Edition)\",\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20669\\/\",\"id\":20669,\"name\":\"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\\/3030-20669\\/\"},\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-72535\\/\",\"id\":72535,\"name\":\"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (Limited Edition)\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\\/3030-20669\\/release\\/3050-72535\\/\"},\"dlc\":null},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/user_review\\/2200-13\\/\",\"date_added\":\"2008-07-21 00:54:52\",\"date_last_updated\":\"2009-11-30 14:23:02\",\"deck\":\"One Of The Best Xbox 360 Games Ever Made\",\"description\":\"<p>All of us Xbox 360 owners have been wating since the 360 came out to play GOW.

Since then, it has become one of Nintendo\\u2019s most popular series, along with Zelda, Metroid and the Mario series in general. The Kart series has made the racing genre much more accessible for everyone. Over the years, the series has been fine-tuned while still retaining its easy-to-pick-up play style. Now, with the introduction of the Wii and the motion-sensor controller, the Mario Kart series continues, and guess what? It\\u2019s more Mario Kart.<br\\/> <br\\/> As previously mentioned, the Mario Kart series has been around since 1992 and since then, has grown to six games (eight if you count the arcade GP games.) With this many games out, the series is bound to repeat itself in a few areas, and for the most part, that\\u2019s fine. The Mario Kart series is known for it\\u2019s ability to be played with friends on the same console, which means there\\u2019s always plenty of fun to be had. Each Rainbow Road is as difficult and exciting as the last, and even unlocking the characters by yourself can be interesting enough to keep you playing for quite some time.<br\\/> <br\\/> But this time around, Mario Kart Wii just seems like more of the same. As mentioned before, while this isn\\u2019t a bad thing overall, returning players will notice a lot of the same tricks and tracks designs from previous games. Some tracks almost feel like the same track from a previous game, but with a different theme and looked at through a mirror. While it\\u2019s not expected that each track be completely original and unique, it just feels like the designers copy and pasted a few tracks.<br\\/> <br\\/> While some of the tracks may give a feeling of deja vu, there are 32 of them to pick from, so at least there\\u2019s a large selection. 16 of the tracks are new, while the other 16 are from previous Kart games. While the ability to choose is nice, some of the \\u201cretro\\u201d tracks that were selected aren\\u2019t all that popular from the previous games, so there isn\\u2019t much of an incentive to play them a second time around, since they weren\\u2019t all that great the first time around.<br\\/> <br\\/> That being said, the retro tracks haven\\u2019t come in untouched. While many of the tracks (mainly the SNES\\/GBA tracks) have been translated into 3D, most of the previous 3D tracks feature some new additions to make them more in tune with the new additions in Mario Kart Wii. But while they have been modified slightly, the tracks will still look and play just as you remember them.<br\\/> <br\\/> In addition to the 32 tracks, there are 25 playable characters in Mario Kart Wii, most of which you\\u2019ll have to unlock. Doing so is a great example of the kind of audience that the Kart series caters to. For some of the characters, you must simply finish the Grand Prix modes and finish in the top three. But for others, you must complete tasks that most Kart players wouldn\\u2019t even consider completing, which means there is a nice reward for the hardcore Kart players.<br\\/> <br\\/> While Mario Kart Wii may cater very well to the hardcore player, it also tries to maintain it\\u2019s pick-up-and-play mechanics, which doesn\\u2019t cross over very well in a number of different ways. Especially in the 150CC races, the items become ridiculous, knocking a first place racer all the way down to 12th in a matter of seconds. Even though this may work to the players advantage, it mainly gives the AI the upper hand, since they have a greater chance of being behind you.<br\\/> <br\\/> Even with the item problems, the algorithm behind the selection can seem off at time, especially during 1-on-1 races. Even though the player in second place is technically in last place, the game still gives them items as if they were in second place, giving them little or no chance to catch back up. This can become frustrating, especially if the gap between the players is quite large, making your defeat almost imminent.<br\\/> <br\\/> On the topic of multiplayer, the Mario Kart Wii still retains the great local multiplayer that the game is known for. However, Battle Mode is now broken down into two teams, and when these games are taken online, they\\u2019re played on maps built for 12 players, rather than the four that are allowed. Also, when playing with three or more people on one console, the game cuts its frames-per-second in half, making it look not nearly as smooth as when one or two people are playing.<br\\/> <br\\/> Outside of local multiplayer, online play has been introduced to the console Kart games, and it\\u2019s a vast improvement over previous Nintendo titles. Games begin quickly, and there is virtually no lag at all. You can race worldwide, in your country only or simply against a few friends. The friend code system is still in place, which means you\\u2019ll have to swap codes if you want to play with friends, but the whole experience is so much quicker and easier than previous attempts, that it can almost be overlooked.<br\\/> <br\\/> In addition to playing online, there is also a new Mario Kart channel for your Wii that comes with the game. It contains leaderboards and stats from yourself and all of your friends. You can compare time trial scores, along with simply spectate current online matches. The channel works without the disc, which makes keeping up with the game rather simple.<br\\/> <br\\/> Another thing that comes with the game is the wheel, which is one of the main draws of the new Kart. Most of the previous racing games make use of the Wii remote itself, but this time around, Nintendo has included an accessory that makes the experience that much more authentic. Along with the wheel, players can use the Gamecube\\/Classic Controller, along with the Wii remote and nunchauk. It\\u2019s all up to your preference, but the new wheel works just fine, especially since it comes free with the game.<br\\/> <br\\/> The last large addition to Mario Kart Wii is the introduction of tricks, not to mention motorcycles. The trick system is quite easy, and gives players a short boost when they land one. There are jumps all over the courses to ensure that players will make full use of this system, especially when it comes to 150CC.<br\\/> <br\\/> Also, bikes have been added into the series, and they feel completely natural. While karts can receive a second \\u2018level\\u2019 speed boosts, bikes can pop a wheelie on straightaways and recieve a slight increase in speed. Also, drifting is no longer determined by players jiggling their joysticks, which eliminates \\u2019snaking\\u2019, giving new players a much better chance at winning online against experience players.<br\\/> <br\\/> Aesthetically is where Mario Kari Wii shines the least. It doesn\\u2019t look much better than the version before it, and even the bystanders in stands, who consist of Miis from your console, are rendered in 2D, which shouldn\\u2019t really even be an option at this point. While a few details have been fine tuned, and the game itself runs very smooth, it just isn\\u2019t a large enough step ahead to be considered up-to-par. Audio-wise, Mario Kart Wii sounds like every Kart game before it, although the character sayings do begin to feel repetitive after landing tricks over and over.<br\\/> <br\\/> Overall, Mario Kart Wii is more Mario Kart. No more, no less. The addition of online play is a nice addition, and in itself is worth getting the game for. So in the end, it comes down to one question: do you like Mario Kart? If the answer is yes, then pick up Mario Kart Wii, because it stays very true to the Kart formula and has plenty of replay value, but don\\u2019t expect to be amazed. If no, then I would still recommend looking into it. It\\u2019s a great game, and definitely a must own for the Wii owner who loves to party.<\\/p>\",\"guid\":\"2200-14\",\"id\":14,\"reviewer\":\"cann3dheat\",\"score\":4,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/mario-kart-wii\\/3030-20645\\/user-reviews\\/2200-14\\/\",\"wikiObject\":\"Mario Kart Wii\",\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20645\\/\",\"id\":20645,\"name\":\"Mario Kart Wii\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/mario-kart-wii\\/3030-20645\\/\"},\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-72512\\/\",\"id\":72512,\"name\":\"Mario Kart Wii\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/mario-kart-wii\\/3030-20645\\/release\\/3050-72512\\/\"},\"dlc\":null}],\"version\":\"1.0\"}",
