This means enclosed levels with set goals. Most goals are timed, but this game doesn't go back to the traditional two-minute run timer found in the first few games. Instead you're dropped into the environment and can trigger goals from a menu (or, when it decides to work properly, you can skate up to an icon in the world and start a goal from there). Some of these goals simply ask you to get a specific score. Others have you playing Simon Says with skateboard tricks, some have you collecting a whole mess of objects as quickly as possible, and so on. The goals in a Tony Hawk game are a huge part of what gives a level its character. Unfortunately, this game seems to have a small number of goal types, and these are simply replicated and remapped onto each of the game's different levels.<\\/p><p>The levels themselves are also a huge part of a Tony Hawk game. Over the years, the franchise has produced some absolute classics. The levels found in Tony Hawk 5 feel like they're about a half-step up from the levels you can create with the game's in-game editor. They have no character and feel slapped together, like someone was in a hurry. There are tons of circular grind areas where you can rack up huge points, but none of it feels custom-crafted for interesting combos. Sure, you'll probably be able to grind, manual, and revert your way from one side of a level to another, but it never feels like you're uncovering some kind of sweet new hidden combo line. The levels feel like they have zero potential and are set in a variety of bland areas, from a standard skatepark to a rooftop level that might be the worst level this franchise has ever produced.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/12139\\/2753059-thps51.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2753059\\\" style=\\\"width: 1138px\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.56239015817223\\\" data-width=\\\"1138\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/12139\\/2753059-thps51.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2753059\\\"><img alt=\\\"No Caption Provided\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/12139\\/2753059-thps51.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/12139\\/2753059-thps51.jpg 1138w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/1\\/12139\\/2753059-thps51.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/12139\\/2753059-thps51.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><\\/figure><p>And then, of course, you'll perform tricks on these levels. The trick system is missing the branching grind system found in earlier games, and there's no flatland trick system at all, which is more than a little disappointing. Double and triple kickflips have changed, with triple kickflips now hiding in the game's new special trick system. Previously, you'd do tricks to fill a meter, and while it was full you could enter specific button combos to perform special tricks. This is how <a href=\\\"\\/tony-hawk\\/3005-13\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-13\\\">Tony Hawk<\\/a> did \\\"The 900\\\" and how <a href=\\\"\\/chad-muska\\/3005-6029\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-6029\\\">Chad Muska<\\/a> did \\\"that thing where he pulled out a boombox or a guitar or whatever once the series started getting weirder and weirder.\\\" Now, that meter fills up, but you have to pop it with a press of the L1\\/LB button. Once active, your normal tricks are replaced with more extravagant ones for a short period of time. It's a lame change. Other lame changes include automatic wallrides, allowing you to put your wheels on a wall by simply jumping in its general direction, and a \\\"slam\\\" that drops you out of the air faster than you would normally. The slam looks awkward and interrupts the flow of the game. In Tony Hawk, that flow is everything. Having this weird, higher-speed move that comes out of nowhere just feels bad. The levels have no flow. Hell, even the menus have no flow.<\\/p><p>OK, let's go deeper. I'm going to put this out there: A big part of what made Tony Hawk so successful back on the original <a href=\\\"\\/playstation\\/3045-22\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3045-22\\\">PlayStation<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"\\/playstation-2\\/3045-19\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3045-19\\\">PS2<\\/a> was the way you could instantly pause the game and restart your run with a few quick presses. Bing, bang, boom, you're back in the game and ready to correct your previous mistake. Games like <a href=\\\"\\/super-meat-boy\\/3030-25114\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-25114\\\">Super Meat Boy<\\/a> benefit from that same sort of quick retry, making trial and error as frictionless as possible. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, starting a goal includes a load screen, which takes you out of the meaningless online freeskate mode and drops you into a solo instance. Then you sit there for a few seconds. Then a menu for the goal in question shows up. Then you have to wait for a little animation to complete, hit a button to start the goal, then your skater teleports to the goal start point and a three-second timer begins. Then, and only then, are you permitted to skate. If you mess up immediately--which, given the trial-and-error nature of some of the game's worst goals, is likely--you need to pause, push down like four times, enter a menu, confirm that you want to retry, then wait while the game hits a load screen and picks up from the \\\"here's what this goal is\\\" part of the previous process.<\\/p><p>This might be the part where you think I'm a maniac. Or that I'm nitpicking. But if you've played the early games in this franchise, you'll understand just how key a quick restart is. And how unforgivable it is that it takes so long to give a goal a fresh run. Oh, hey, while I'm at it, you have to quit all the way to the main menu to change levels or dig through the game's awkward skater select screen to spend stat points or mess with the game's reduced version of a character creator. Stuff like this just hammers home this sinking feeling that the people responsible for this game had no idea what made those early games so incredible in the first place. It's probably not worth speculating about that, but here's what <em>is<\\/em> clear: THPS5 misses the big picture, but it also gets every single little nuance wrong, too.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2753061\\\" style=\\\"width: 1138px\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.56239015817223\\\" data-width=\\\"1138\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2753061\\\"><img alt=\\\"No Caption Provided\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg 1138w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg 480w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"No Caption Provided\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg 1138w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/12139\\/2753061-thps4.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><\\/figure><p>The freeskate online lobbies exist and let you see other skaters, but there aren't any meaningful ways to interact with those skaters unless you invite them into a party. Then you could try a co-op goal or get into the game's multiplayer, which is missing key multiplayer modes like \\\"horse\\\" and \\\"graffiti.\\\" The whole concept seems like it was in there from the start and meant for a bigger, more fully featured game, but never got cut out when the rest of the mode didn't come together.<\\/p><p>On top of all that, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is a technical mess, too. The game's framerate is all over the place. It's entirely too easy to fall through parts of the world or get jammed up inside of walls. User-created parks seem to suffer from these issues more frequently than the pre-made parks, at least, though user-made parks also tend to have objects that flicker and shimmer in the distance, like they're not all there. Sometimes you can't select goals by skating up to them and are forced to pull up an in-game menu when the Square\\/X button stops actually, like, starting goals. Lastly, the game doesn't bother to tell you when you've unlocked the next level, so if you have achievement notifications turned off, you'll have to count your stars to know when it's time to leave one sorry environment for the next.<\\/p><p>I could go on and on, and if you've been watching our Quick Look or hearing me talk about the game on our <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/podcasts\\/giant-bombcast-10062015\\/1600-1375\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1600-1375\\\">podcast<\\/a>, you probably know a few more details. But, really, the only thing worth knowing is that no part of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is worth your time. It's bad. Real bad. And not the type of bad that makes for good comedy, either. It'd be bad at any price, but it's especially egregious that the publisher is charging a full $60 for this sucker. It'd be something you'd want to avoid for even a third of that price. Don't waste your time. You deserve better. Tony Hawk deserves better.

Then things started going downhill, and a few years back, EA tried to reboot the franchise as <a href=\\\"\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/nba-elite-11\\/3030-31438\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-31438\\\">NBA Elite<\\/a> with an all-new engine and all the expected trimmings. It was a disaster. EA cancelled the title just days before it was expected to hit store shelves. A few copies did slip out into the wild, and the resulting YouTube videos showcased what looked to be the nadir of an already downtrodden franchise, a game so distressingly broken that EA would rather take a bath on scrapping what it had rather than dare to let the public see what horrors it had wrought.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2578921-nbalive14_ps4_kyrie_irving_pass.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2578921\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2578921-nbalive14_ps4_kyrie_irving_pass.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2578921\\\"><img alt=\\\"NBA Live is back, I guess.

Yay?<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>How mortifying was the NBA Elite experience? Bad enough that it's taken EA three years to try the NBA thing again. Originally it was supposed to be two, but then another year went by before the company was able to finally conjure up <a href=\\\"\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/nba-live-14\\/3030-42864\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-42864\\\">NBA Live 14<\\/a>. With so much time between the Elite boondoggle and now, you'd hope that EA would have been able to come up with at least one revelatory feature, one thing that would make it stand out from its oft-praised competitor. Instead, NBA Live 14 is a game that feels tentative at every turn, a game that feels preoccupied with mere functionality, versus anything even resembling innovation. The core tenets, strategies, and mechanics of the game of basketball are all represented here in thoroughly unspectacular fashion. It has the skeletal structures of modes you'd expect in a modern sports game, but none of the depth, detail, or excitement necessary to make them fun. It's as flat and flavorless a representation of professional basketball as I can ever remember seeing.<\\/p><p>This is apparent from the moment you boot up NBA Live 14 and jump into a game. From the opening tip-off, Live's malformed player models, clunky animations, and peculiarly suspect frame rate (especially on the PS4 version) all immediately gather up to greet you and let you know you've made an unfortunate purchase. Even if you discount the astoundingly good player models in <a href=\\\"\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/nba-2k14\\/3030-42632\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-42632\\\">NBA 2K14<\\/a>, NBA Live 14 doesn't look like it was developed for new console hardware. When you do factor in the competition, NBA Live 14 looks downright tragic. Few faces seem to resemble their real-life counterparts, and most players have this stiff, gangly look to them that gives them an altogether unnerving quality.<\\/p><p>The one big, new-ish feature EA has touted for this game is its BounceTek system, essentially a buzzword for its right-stick-based dribbling system. Strangely, the game has no useful tutorial to explain how this system works. The only tutorial, actually, is a short, baffling afterthought of a video that just shows you that it <em>has<\\/em> three tiers of complexity, without ever actually <em>demonstrating<\\/em> how to best take advantage of said complexities. That BounceTek system actually does work reasonably well (once you research how it actually works, then learn the appropriate timing), but the fact that I had to wander into <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.easports.com\\/nba-live\\/news-updates-gameplay\\/article\\/nba-live-14-gameplay\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"false\\\">EA's official blog<\\/a> to get any useful info on how it works is kind of ridiculous.<\\/p><p>While you might be able to get the hang of BounceTek's timing, a bigger issue is that everything else in NBA Live 14 constantly feels a step behind your reaction time. In-game animations are programmed so haphazardly that it constantly feels like the game is lagging behind whatever you've just asked it to do. Want to try to trip up a defender by playing around with the right-analog stick dribbling, change direction, then try to cut through to the paint on a layup? You can do that, but you basically have to wait for each movement to complete before putting in the next move, which takes considerably longer than one would expect. You have to be careful about it too, otherwise you'll probably accidentally make your guy do about seven other things you didn't intend because you hit the buttons over and over again wondering why the game wasn't responding to your presses.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"center\\\" data-size=\\\"large\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/2840\\/2495675-kyrie_eanbtr_still005_withwatermark.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2495675\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/2840\\/2495675-kyrie_eanbtr_still005_withwatermark.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2495675\\\"><img alt=\\\"No aspect of NBA Live 14's gameplay feels correct.

The timing for everything you do feels well behind the kind of quick responses you need to play basketball effectively.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>This isn't just an issue of spamming commands and the game not responding, but more a matter of having to constantly wait for the game to catch up to the pace on the court. Did you just swipe the ball out of an offensive player's hand, and would you like to run up and grab it and take it down the lane for a fast break? Terrific, first you'll have to wait for both players to finish their peculiarly long \\\"ball just fell out of a player's hand\\\" animation, then watch both players stumble around for a second, then you'll have to try and direct your player's momentum in the direction of the ball, wait a half-second for him to pick it up, then wait another second for him to transition into his dribbling animation, and--oh, whoops! The entire opposing defense already got set at the other end of the court. Too bad! These sorts of momentum killing situations are everywhere in NBA Live 14. Your reaction time will almost always be quicker than what the game is capable of responding to. In a game as quickly paced as basketball, not being able to make effective moves on the fly is straight-up inexcusable.<\\/p><p>It's a mess made messier by a host of other small, nagging gameplay issues. Camera problems are prevalent under several different settings, with some instances of the camera just straight up refusing to move back down the court with you until you take a timeout or switch the camera to a different setting entirely. Until you get very good at using the BounceTek to fake defenders out, defending players stick to you like glue, only occasionally leaving an opening if they inexplicably decide to all converge in the paint (leaving multiple open players on the perimeter) or if they just decide to fall over for no identifiable reason whatsoever. Trying to set up pick-and-rolls--or, really, just about anything that doesn't involve you tossing the ball to your biggest guy and hoping he can score in the paint--is a deeply frustrating experience that repeated practice and unending patience never quite manage to improve. You don't get better at NBA Live 14 so much as you just learn how better to exploit it.<\\/p><p>There is nothing here to justify learning how to exploit it, mind you. This game is not very much fun in any facet of its execution, and the supporting modes don't make the crappy basketball-playing any better. The game's franchise mode is so bare-bones it might as well have been decomposing in a desert for a century, and the Rising Star mode--essentially the game's answer to NBA 2K's MyCareer mode--is, at best, a sketch of a good idea. Here, you just make your own player using some basic presets, get drafted by a team (whether they actually need a player at your position or not), and then proceed to play a bunch of games while trying to earn good grades for achieving vague objectives. There's no storyline here, nor anything to really keep you interested beyond the notion of just playing a player you created and trying not to suck enough to get decent grades. Mostly, it's just dull, with a dash of the infuriating when your AI teammates suddenly go full-lobotomy and just sit there with the ball, dribbling until the shot clock goes down to almost nothing. You can call for a pass whenever that happens, but it happens so often that you often end up in a situation where you have to constantly prod your team into doing much of anything. Incidentally, this happens in any situation where the game locks you to a single player. It seems like Live's A.I. just isn't programmed to respond intelligently to having to move the ball around itself, as opposed to having player control switch from player-to-player as you pass it.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2578923\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2578923\\\"><img alt=\\\"I like the implementation of NBA Live 14's live season mode--it's just a shame you have to actually play NBA Live 14 to take advantage of it.\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg 720w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg 480w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"I like the implementation of NBA Live 14's live season mode--it's just a shame you have to actually play NBA Live 14 to take advantage of it.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg 720w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/39\\/2578923-nba-live-season-2.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>I like the implementation of NBA Live 14's live season mode--it's just a shame you have to actually play NBA Live 14 to take advantage of it.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>While these modes are merely dull, online play is straight-up garbage. Lag is constant, making an already unwieldy game that much more infuriating. Every game I played devolved into free-for-alls where all anyone could do was try to throw players toward the paint and hope the animation for a halfway makeable shot would happen. Timing on any other kind of shot is so horrid that you simply can't rely on them. If by some miracle you are able to start draining threes or making free-throws with any consistency, then you are probably some kind of server lag wizard and your powers should be put to use on better games than this one.<\\/p><p>I suppose there are some positives worth lauding in NBA Live 14. Its live season mode, which regularly updates the game with challenges based on scenarios taking place during the current NBA season, is well-implemented and seems to be getting updated very quickly. Ultimate Team is about as solid as any other implementation of the concept in EA's other sports titles this year (though it maddeningly lacks the auction feature found in every other game), and I did think the game's broadcast presentation--namely its pre-game and halftime stat overlays and solid (if deeply repetitive) commentary from Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy--was pretty good. Unfortunately, these few bright spots aren't nearly enough to make NBA Live 14 appear as anything but a perfunctory, depressing mess. Yes, EA is making basketball games again, and perhaps that's a good thing, given that competition generally pushes developers to do more interesting things than they would otherwise. But if NBA Live 14 is any indication, it's going to be a long time before 2K Sports needs to acknowledge, let alone worry about, what EA's up to.<\\/p>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-42864\\/\",\"id\":42864,\"name\":\"NBA Live 14\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/nba-live-14\\/3030-42864\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-619\",\"id\":619,\"publish_date\":\"2013-12-11 16:16:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-129745\\/\",\"id\":129745,\"name\":\"NBA Live 14\"},\"reviewer\":\"Alex\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/nba-live-14-review\\/1900-619\\/\",\"platforms\":\"Xbox One, PlayStation 4\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-566\\/\",\"deck\":\"This is not the Walking Dead game you're looking for.\",\"description\":\"<p>You aren't likely to see a starker, more immediately relevant example of the differences between a thoughtfully produced licensed game, and a cheap, barely thought-out cash-in, than you will between the two games currently bearing the name The Walking Dead.

Survival Instinct is a far more action-oriented game than Telltale's traditional adventure, and also is told almost exclusively from the first-person perspective of the show's favorite survivalist, <a href=\\\"\\/daryl-dixon\\/3005-23620\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3005-23620\\\">Daryl Dixon<\\/a>. The story is something of a prequel to the events of the TV series, showing the early goings of the outbreak that slaughters the majority of the human race, as well as Daryl and his brother Merle's early misadventures in a now post-apocalyptic society. Norman Reedus and <a href=\\\"\\/michael-rooker\\/3040-84143\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3040-84143\\\">Michael Rooker<\\/a> appear to voice their respective characters with decent enthusiasm (if not particularly authentic acting), and the developers at <a href=\\\"\\/terminal-reality-inc\\/3010-1531\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3010-1531\\\">Terminal Reality<\\/a> did do a pretty good job of capturing both actors' likenesses and expressions for the purposes of the game. Unfortunately, those are probably the last nice things I'm going to say about Survival Instinct.<\\/p><p>Where to begin? Pretty much from the opening seconds, Survival Instinct makes minimal effort to immerse you in anything resembling an even moderately living world. Environments are bland, linear, and haggard looking in a way that seems less the fault of the apocalypse than the environment and texture artists tasked with trying to make this thing look halfway decent. And that's before you've even killed zombie one. The second those god awful-looking creatures start shambling up to you, the whole thing just falls the hell apart.<\\/p><p>Nearly everything else the matter with Survival Instinct can be traced back to the undead hordes shuffling their way around the game's various areas. They're ugly, though again, not in a way that's so much frightening as it is deeply disappointing. Zombie AI is one of those things I'm always somewhat reluctant to criticize, since trying to program the purely instinctual, largely thoughtless behavior of tattered ghouls can't be an exact science. But in Survival Instinct, the science seems to have been abandoned altogether. Zombies are terrible at finding you in the most bizarre of circumstances. Walk past a certain fence or doorway, and they'll just lose complete track of you, or worse yet, still know where you are, but find themselves unable to traverse the corner of the door they've somehow become hooked upon. In open spaces they'll certainly come at you, often in large groups that can't really be fought, in which case your best bet is often just to flee.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"center\\\" data-size=\\\"large\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/2457230-walking_dead_survival_instinct-3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2457230\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.56346153846154\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/2457230-walking_dead_survival_instinct-3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2457230\\\"><img alt=\\\"Zombies are inconsistent about how aware they are of your presence.

This guy might ignore you as you creep by, or spot you from 20 feet away. You never know.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>That is maybe the one germ of a good idea Survival Instinct is infected with. Instead of turning the game into a zombie killing bloodbath, Terminal Reality at least tried something different by making the encounters with the undead more overwhelming than predicated on endless zombie killing. Little details, like the game's focus on silent, hand-to-hand weaponry, and the fact that you actually sweat when running for too long (which looks awful, but apparently alerts zombies to your presence via their sense of smell), are nifty concepts that just don't play out very well in execution. In reality, the game focuses so much on non-shooting weapons that guns border on useless. They're incredibly noisy, for one, and also aren't really any fun to shoot. Even Daryl's trademark crossbow, which the game goes out of its way to fuss over when you first get it, is downright awful to use.<\\/p><p>So instead of running around like a zombie killing machine, you'll find yourself creeping around quite a lot, sneaking up on hapless walkers when they're by themselves, and creeping past groups whenever you can. Of course, you can't always avoid a conflict, in which case you must run to the blazes, lest the horde catch up to you. However, any real sense of fear one might feel from having an active football roster's worth of cannibalistic corpses pursuing you is largely negated when you actually find yourself up close and personal with a group. This scenario enacts a \\\"grapple\\\" mechanic where, one at a time, zombies will get all up in your face while you try to steer your knife in the direction of said zombie's face to pull off an initially brutal-looking kill move. Then you do it again. And again. And again. And again and again and again until you either screw up enough to die, or have actually killed an entire horde of zombies with only a knife and a severely broken game mechanic to thank for your life. I think I maybe killed off at least five or six major groupings of zombies this way. The rest of the time, I either managed to escape to the random green box I had to find to end the current mission objective, or died.<\\/p><p>I died a lot in Survival Instinct, which maybe makes it all the sadder that it only took me five, maybe six hours to finish the whole damn thing. The storytelling is spartan to the point of very nearly not existing, which means that much of the time you're spending in the game revolves around annoying resource gathering and errand missions that are not only not fun, but incredibly frustrating as the game's difficulty progressively climbs higher. Which is to say nothing of the completely pointless, and utterly unpleasant side ventures the game saddles you with between story sections. In between these sections, you are asked what route you would like to take to the next area. Taking the highway, for instance, is a faster route that also provides few scavenging opportunities for supplies, like gas and food. You need those things, because without gas, you can't get to the next destination. Whatever route you take, you'll eventually have to make a stop between missions, and these all take place in the same handful of recycled environments, with the same recycled objectives again and again. They are awful, pointless padding that offer nothing beyond a way to extend what would otherwise be a mercifully brief playtime.<\\/p><p>As awful as Survival Instinct is mechanically, the really depressing thing about it is that it offers no meaningful information or commentary on the characters it revolves around. Yes, Daryl and Merle's lives are a bit more fleshed out, but nothing you learn is anything you couldn't have gone the rest of your life not knowing. Even worse are the various side characters you'll pick up along the way, who you can actually chose to bring with you, or leave behind, depending on your affinity for them, and the kind of room you might have in your current vehicle. These characters exist, but that's about all they do. They're given few, if any opportunities to endear themselves to the player, and not a single one of their various death scenes elicited more than a casual shrug from me. It's hard to feel much for people who you never make any meaningful connection with, you know?<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/18\\/184038\\/2455021-keepaneyeout.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2455021\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/18\\/184038\\/2455021-keepaneyeout.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2455021\\\"><img alt=\\\"Actually, this represents the final visual quality of Survival Instinct quite nicely.

Telltale found a way to make you care about even the most minimally present characters in your group. It crafted relationships that became increasingly complex as the episodes went along. Survival Instinct's limp attempt at similar survivor relationships doesn't even compare.<\\/p><p>I realize comparing what are obviously two very different games, mechanically speaking, isn't entirely fair. I also realize that Terminal Reality was likely saddled with a thankless, under-resourced task in making this game, one that has been quoted as coming together from conception to release in less than a year's time. The thing is, you can see the basic framework of a completely competent zombie game in Survival Instinct. With a stronger budget, more time, and a bit more care and craft, I could almost see this game being good. Sadly, what's ended up on shelves benefited from no such factors, leaving players with an abysmally rushed game of barely connected ideas that brings the player little more than frustration and disappointment.<\\/p>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-38900\\/\",\"id\":38900,\"name\":\"The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct\\/3030-38900\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-566\",\"id\":566,\"publish_date\":\"2013-03-21 13:19:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-123639\\/\",\"id\":123639,\"name\":\"The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct\"},\"reviewer\":\"Alex\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct-review\\/1900-566\\/\",\"platforms\":\"PlayStation 3\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-558\\/\",\"deck\":\"Both functionally broken and creatively bankrupt, Aliens: Colonial Marines is an extinction-level disaster.\",\"description\":\"<p>Many have chided Ridley Scott's recent sort-of-<em>Alien<\\/em>-prequel <em>Prometheus<\\/em> as a cynical, unnecessary retcon of the existing <em>Alien<\\/em> canon that never quite justified its own existence. <a href=\\\"\\/aliens-colonial-marines\\/3030-20921\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-20921\\\">Aliens: Colonial Marines <\\/a>makes <em>Prometheus<\\/em> look vital by comparison. <a href=\\\"\\/gearbox-software-llc\\/3010-1615\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3010-1615\\\">Gearbox Software<\\/a>, who were ostensibly in charge of the seven-year operation required to bring this thing to fruition, have spent much of that time talking about just how much they loved <em>Aliens<\\/em>.

It's been overrun with xenomorphs, as well as <a href=\\\"\\/weyland-yutani\\/3015-5134\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3015-5134\\\">Weyland-Yutani<\\/a> hired mercenaries, who have seemingly been conducting an operation on the planet and the ship. You, as marine Christopher Winters, begin the game by storming the Sulaco looking to aid your comrades in battle against the Wey-U soldiers and horrible creatures that have infested it, but eventually will end up back on LV-426, trapped in a much larger, and much stupider conspiracy than you'd ever dreamed.<\\/p><p>This is one of the biggest fundamental flaws of Colonial Marines, and one it shares with <em>Prometheus<\\/em>. Namely, this game feels like it was built around its setpieces, and not the other way around. Granted, at least <em>Prometheus<\\/em> grew out of the germ of an idea that was answering the question of who the giant \\\"Space Jockey\\\" was that the hapless humans of the original <em>Alien<\\/em> stumbled upon. That question may not have had the most coherent of answers, but at least it made a half-hearted effort to answer <i>something<\\/i>. Colonial Marines instead takes the Star Tours approach, picking key locations from<em> Alien<\\/em> and<em> Aliens<\\/em> for the player to arrive at and proceed to gawk toward, while building a hacky, totally uninteresting story around why the player has to go to those places.<\\/p><p>Lacking a coherent story direction, the game relies on its main characters to build up the drama. Unfortunately, we're saddled with Winters and a few other marine grunts who offer no identifiable personality outside of their endless recycled references to \\\"no marine left behind\\\" and patently unconvincing \\\"ooh-rahs!\\\" By the time the tatters of the team end up on LV-426, the game finally begins showing its hand, offering up ridiculous plot twists and poorly executed conspiracies that just add a giant pile of nonsense to the nifty, if somewhat vague premise of <em>Alien 3<\\/em>. I cannot explain much beyond that without outright spoiling the game, but let's just say that a late-game cameo (that the game telegraphs in its opening credits) is one of the dumbest, most hamfisted twists in anything of <em>Alien's<\\/em> canon. Yes, dumber than the entire <em>Aliens vs. Predator<\\/em> franchise.<\\/p><p>The worst part is that it does this for no real reason other than the sake of having another character you recognize in the mix. The existence of <a href=\\\"\\/lance-henriksen\\/3040-61906\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3040-61906\\\">Lance Henriksen's<\\/a> Bishop at least makes canonical sense since he's a mass-produced artificial lifeform, but all this cameo character does is show up, try to explain away his appearance by actively avoiding trying to explain away his appearance--they literally answer a key plot question by saying \\\"That's another, longer story...\\\"--and then proceed to do nothing of note or consequence for the rest of the game. It's a twist for the sake of a twist, and nothing more.<\\/p><p>In absence of proper storytelling, Colonial Marines must then rely on its gameplay to keep your attention. This is most unfortunate for a number of reasons. As a first-person shooter, Colonial Marines is at least a basically functional piece of work. The weaponry you're provided is neat and authentic, right down to the gunfire sound effects you remember from the movie. Yet, the action is deeply unsatisfying. The whole crux of the game, namely the violence done between man and xenomorph, is an unconscionable mess. Granted, combat in <em>Aliens<\\/em> mostly boiled down to big, tough marines being savaged by creatures their weaponry and hubris could not stand up to, and that would probably not make for much of a game if repeated over long level sections in a shooter. So instead, xenos come frolicking after you, bounding up one leap at a time until they're right up in your face, swiping and snarling until you pump enough bullets into them to make them dissolve into acidic goo.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2430647\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2430647\\\"><img alt=\\\"Multiplayer seems well-meaning, but isn't nearly balanced nor interesting enough to keep your attention.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/39\\/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/39\\/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/39\\/2430647-2309243-screenhunter_62_sep.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>Multiplayer seems well-meaning, but isn't nearly balanced nor interesting enough to keep your attention.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>Yes, this does become quite repetitive. The xenomorphs just aren't built to surprise you, or force you to really do anything other than just fire at anything that looks black and menacing. They crawl around on walls, sure, but the way they're scripted to attack robs the game of any tension or excitement. You will hear a blip on your motion tracker (a largely useless device in the context of this game), and suddenly there will be bad guys. Considering this game's only scare tactic is to have aliens start crawling out of air vents or bursting out of floors when you supposedly least expect it--keep in mind, it does this in pretty much every other corridor or room--this solitary ping is a shockingly ill-conceived move, in that it steels you for what's about to come every single time. If you had to actually use the motion tracker (which replaces the gun in your hand) for any kind of early warning, that'd make for some interesting, tense moments as you scan around for movement. But no, all you have to do is wait for the ping, and have your gun ready.<\\/p><p>That Colonial Marines' campaign so thoroughly lacks in dread or terror is perhaps the most damning thing I can say about it. The only time the game pulls off anything even resembling unease is during a brief scene when your character is alone and without weapons. Zombie xenomorphs (no, seriously) who cannot see but can sense motion stumble around in Hadley's Hope's sewage, and as you fumble around in the dark, you're unsure which alien husks are still alive, and which are dead. For a moment, this is terrifying, but then the first moving zombie xeno appears, begins glowing an irradiated green, and then runs toward something moving and explodes. Suddenly, the scary gives way to the silly, and any hope you might have had of being properly frightened just flies out the window.<\\/p><p>The zombie xenos are dumb-looking, but really all of the game's xenos are dumb-acting. Far from the efficient killing machines of the movies, these xenos are clumsy, dimwitted, and seemingly incapable of handling even just a few broken-down marines. The AI will frequently bug out, so to speak, leaving xenos pathetically trying to crawl up stairs, getting hung up in doorways, or just standing at unremarkable distances, stoically, as you pump dozens of rounds into them. Human enemies aren't much better, though they usually are able to walk around basic obstacles and even use cover.<\\/p><p>AI bugs are just one of the many technical issues that plague Colonial Marines. There are serious glitches to be found elsewhere, often in the vein of weird debug code popping into random gameplay sequences and then just disappearing, environments simply not loading properly, or character and xenomorph animations flipping out into spazzy, bizarre flurries of movement. It's ugly stuff made even uglier by the world surrounding it. Sure, the artists involved in this game's development nailed a lot of the little details from the movie, from the ship design of the Sulaco, to the decimated ruins of Hadley's Hope down on the planet. But those things all had reference material, something to copy from, rather than something to be outright created. Where the game is forced to fill in the margins is where it gets downright unpleasant. Character models are bug-eyed, emotionless, and generally poorly animated, while environments often look crusty and poorly lit. No, I don't mean in that \\\"we're keeping it dark to maintain a sense of dread\\\" kind of way. I mean in that \\\"we're trying to keep your eyes off these years-old looking environmental textures\\\" kind of way.<\\/p><p>Some will undoubtedly complain that the single-player campaign, which can also be played cooperatively (more on that in a moment), doesn't take longer than maybe five hours to finish. However, I don't consider that to be one of the game's faults. In absence of a strong story, Colonial Marines already drags as it plods along, tossing xenomorph after xenomorph at you, struggling mightily to get you to all the different landmarks it figures you're itching to see while also maintaining some semblance of an atmosphere. As it is, the campaign is merely severely disappointing and often unpleasant. Were it any longer, it'd be be outright unbearable.<\\/p><p>As for the co-op, it has all the hallmarks of a feature hastily tossed in late in a development cycle. Up to four players can experience this idiotic story together, but only one character is really acknowledged or even focused on for the duration. You don't take over the roles of AI teammates already embedded in the story, but rather other marines who simply do not exist otherwise. Worse, many levels were clearly not designed for multiple people. Corridors are cramped to the point of bursting, which makes particularly heated firefights against the xenos utterly incomprehensible. And that level I mentioned earlier, the one where you have no guns? Right, that still happens, but with multiple people, which is hilarious since characters will often warp to one another if they become too far separated. This will tip off the bad guys, which results in explosions of acid and death. The only time the co-op seems to function as intended is out on the surface of LV-426, where open spaces let you gain your bearings and actually work together properly. Unfortunately, you're still fighting the same dumb enemies, but at least it's an improvement.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2430625-alienscolonialmarinesvideopreview610.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2430625\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.56229508196721\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/2430625-alienscolonialmarinesvideopreview610.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2430625\\\"><img alt=\\\"This is Alex, a survivor of Aliens: Colonial Marines, signing off.

Don't play this game.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>Elsewhere, there is competitive multiplayer featuring teams of marines and xenomorphs. The playable xenomorphs are an interesting idea (that has, admittedly, been done better elsewhere), in that they can climb walls, have different attack classes (spitters can do ranged attacks, while lurkers can move more stealthily), and require a different sort of teamwork than playing as a marine. Unfortunately, too many of the game's multiplayer modes favor the marines, who are far better armed and better equipped to handle the xenos than the reverse. Xenos are remarkably easy to kill, which means the xenos are forced to stay stealthy. Doing so is easier said than done, and the lack of attack variety in the playable xenos eventually leads you to wonder if it's even worth the trouble. Nailing a marine the first few times is actually quite satisfying, but as matches wear on, it becomes far less so.<\\/p><p>It's strange and depressing thing to consider a game like Aliens: Colonial Marines. Think of all the potential, the time, the effort, the budget used up over these last several years, only to produce something so deeply, fundamentally flawed in every facet of its execution. Instead of the properly reverent <em>Aliens<\\/em> sequel Gearbox supposedly set out to make, they've shoved this awful, grotesque thing into the chest cavity of the very franchise that they purported to love. I kind of hope that disappoints them, because it sure as hell disappointed me.<\\/p>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20921\\/\",\"id\":20921,\"name\":\"Aliens: Colonial Marines\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/aliens-colonial-marines\\/3030-20921\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-558\",\"id\":558,\"publish_date\":\"2013-02-13 11:03:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-73354\\/\",\"id\":73354,\"name\":\"Aliens: Colonial Marines\"},\"reviewer\":\"Alex\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/aliens-colonial-marines-review\\/1900-558\\/\",\"platforms\":\"PC\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-553\\/\",\"deck\":\"If you are a fundamentally terrible person on every imaginable level, then Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse is the video game for you.\",\"description\":\"<p>Great news, racists, misogynists, homophobes, and generally terrible people!

Then again, shock value would also imply that you could actually be shocked by any of this stuff. If anything, the only shocking aspect of Back to the Multiverse is how haphazardly said offensive terms are doled out over the course of the game's brief adventure.<\\/p><p>While there is a story in Back to the Multiverse--which features <i>Family Guy<\\/i> stalwarts <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-1372\\\" href=\\\"\\/stewie-griffin\\/3005-1372\\/\\\" slug=\\\"stewie-griffin\\\">Stewie<\\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-3464\\\" href=\\\"\\/brian-griffin\\/3005-3464\\/\\\" slug=\\\"brian-griffin\\\">Brian<\\/a> teaming up to save the world from a dimension-hopping villain baby--it largely plays second fiddle to the simple act of running around an environment filled with some minority or another, shooting everything in sight, while frequently repeating lines from the show.<\\/p><p>Yes, there is a lot of recycled dialogue in Back to the Multiverse, most of it unremarkable, barely-remembered one-liners from its main characters. You can tell the difference between what's old and what's new by the fact that the old lines occasionally feel like they were part of a larger joke. The new dialogue doesn't even know what a larger joke is. If it takes more than ten seconds to set up, deliver, and forget about, Back to the Multiverse doesn't even bother.<\\/p><p>With that said, I don't know that Back to the Multiverse was so much \\\"written\\\" as it was \\\"hastily slapped together,\\\" but no matter, because the most important thing is that you're being horrible to those that are probably different from you. The game literally opens with a rapid-fire assault highlighting the grossness of Greek people and the sluttiness (and requisite daddy issues) of sorority chicks, and then dovetails into a lovely little level-length treatise on handicapped people and their terrifying sense of entitlement.<\\/p><p>To be fair, not all of Back to the Multiverse is obsessed with calling things queer and the hilariously slutty antics of women. Later in the game, things move into more decidedly bizarre territory, featuring long stretches where you're killing Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Mayor McCheese, and space chickens that behave similarly to the <a data-ref-id=\\\"3015-4530\\\" href=\\\"\\/xenomorph\\/3015-4530\\/\\\" slug=\\\"xenomorph\\\">Xenomorphs<\\/a> from <i>Alien<\\/i>.

There's no real challenge to Back to the Multiverse. You'll die if you get shot up, but unless you've completely run out of the game's collectible currency, you'll always start right back where you got shot. Well, until the last few levels, which inexplicably have a tendency to start you way further back than seems reasonable. But otherwise, you're just running around, blasting wildly until everything's dead.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/9493\\/2371454-012721.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2371454\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/9493\\/2371454-012721.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2371454\\\"><img alt=\\\"Some might think that Back to the Multiverse is just emblematic of its source material, but it's not.

The mechanics function more like a lousy arena shooter than a typical third-person adventure, so there's a lot of running and shooting, and not much else. If we were talking about a game with a challenge level similar to, say, <a data-ref-id=\\\"3025-373\\\" href=\\\"\\/serious-sam\\/3025-373\\/\\\" slug=\\\"serious-sam\\\">Serious Sam<\\/a>, that might have worked out better. But Back to the Multiverse isn't interested in challenging you so much as it is killing time until its next offensive one-liner.<\\/p><p>This all makes a bit more sense when you try out Back to the Multiverse's barely existent multiplayer. Yes, there's two-player co-op in the campaign, but if your desire to force Back to the Multiverse on people requires more sacrifices, there are offline deathmatch and \\\"capture the greased-up deaf guy\\\" modes to play around with. Incidentally, all relevant humor in the \\\"capture the greased-up deaf guy\\\" mode can be found in the title \\\"capture the greased-up deaf guy,\\\" so really, you don't even have to play it to get the joke.<\\/p><p>If you're the sort of person who doesn't inherently find the concepts of greased-up deaf people, Amish people commenting on their sex lives, older women grotesquely demanding group sex from frat boys, people in wheelchairs falling over, or \\\"the gays\\\" completely hilarious, do not get angry at Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse. This is not a game that deserves your anger. If it in any way felt deliberate, focused, or frankly invested in its own sense of humor, then maybe it would be deserving of such ire. As it is, Back to the Multiverse is a game that those with any modicum of taste should simply forget ever happened.

While this could have served as an interesting segue between the events of that game and the just-released <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-38039\\\" href=\\\"\\/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii\\/3030-38039\\/\\\" slug=\\\"call-of-duty-black-ops-ii\\\">Black Ops II<\\/a>, Declassified is a disjointed mess of meaningless missions played against a clock backed up with a multiplayer mode that occasionally approximates something that resembled proper <a data-ref-id=\\\"3025-82\\\" href=\\\"\\/call-of-duty\\/3025-82\\/\\\" slug=\\\"call-of-duty\\\">Call of Duty<\\/a> combat. More often, though, the game feels too small to be entertaining, with maps so tiny that you'll literally spawn with an enemy in your crosshairs... or vice versa. This would be a questionable purchase at traditional downloadable pricing. But at $50? No way.<\\/p><p>To fit on the Vita, some control adjustments have been made. The triggers handle your aiming and shooting, but many of the other maneuvers--grenade tossing and melee attacks, specifically--have been moved to the touch screen. The rear touch is used to steady your aim while sniping and the game utilizes an auto-sprint option to keep things moving at a Call of Duty-like pace. But at best, controlling the action feels like a bootleg knockoff of real Call of Duty. Basic movement feels awkward and the auto-sprint feels unreliable, making it tougher to get away from grenades. It almost feels like the developers realized this, because the fuses on grenades feel way longer. Call of Duty has always been about snapping to your target when playing against AI opposition, and that snapping feels positively vital on the Vita. Turning with the right stick, despite a sensitivity slider, never feels <i>right<\\/i>. Multiplayer matches, as a result, look like a collection of broken robots mindlessly running around tight corridors, passing one another, then clumsily turning to fire. As if that all wasn't weird enough, all enemies--human or otherwise--feel like they take three or four more bullets to drop. It's a messy game to play, and that feel permeates every mode.<\\/p><p>The primary solo mode is a series of profoundly short time trials that put you, as either Alex Mason or Frank Woods, into a quick mission. You're given a few seconds of start-up storyline and sent on your way. There are no checkpoints, so if you die, shoot hostages, or stumble into some other failure state, you'll have to start the entire mission over. Most missions are only a few minutes long, so the lack of checkpoints isn't the end of the world, but it sure is a weird thing to include as your main single-player mode. You'll get cutscenes between missions, but no overarching story.<\\/p><p>The AI you'll face in these missions is embarrassing. Enemies, seemingly aware that the game's controls are kind of bad, occasionally just stand there for a bit, giving you time to take them out at your leisure. Sometimes enemies two rooms ahead of you will just start shooting in your direction where they stand, even though there are multiple walls between you and them. Incidentally, this actually works out in your favor in some cases, since the game is sort of bad about telling you where you're supposed to be going. So just follow the gunfire. In an ideal situation, these missions would be good enough to inspire you to play them over and over again and place higher on the game's online leaderboards. But that is most definitely not the case.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/6\\/63119\\/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2295389\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/6\\/63119\\/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2295389\\\"><img alt=\\\"The enemy AI is wildly erratic and feels broken at times.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/6\\/63119\\/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/6\\/63119\\/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg 1024w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/6\\/63119\\/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/6\\/63119\\/2295389-blops_decl3.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>The enemy AI is wildly erratic and feels broken at times.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>The game also has a handful of time trials, which pit you against wooden targets as you try to get through a set of obstacle courses as quickly as possible. Hey, remember how Call of Duty games used to have the training course thing that would let you see which difficulty mode you should play on? Ever wish that this old idea was turned into a small mode of its own? Yeah, me neither. Hostiles mode, which is a wave-based survival mode, spawns in dozens of enemies for you to gun down and, between waves, drops supply crates to let you restock. Enemies typically make a beeline for your location, but they're also likely to get hung up on level geometry and just sort of vibrate up against a wall.<\\/p><p>The most interesting option is eight-player multiplayer, which is built on a limited set of the same fundamentals that power other Call of Duty games. You'll gain levels, create custom classes with perks, weapon attachments, and more. It has a handful of modes, too, including Kill Confirmed and Drop Zone, which has you fighting over control of a single point on the map. It can handle up to eight players, which manages to be enough for the little maps included in the game. Remember how Nuketown always seemed like it was a little small? How about Nuke<i>house<\\/i>, which is a sectioned-off half of the original Nuketown map? No? On one hand, there's something novel about a handheld version of Call of Duty. But not like this.<\\/p><p>The game is strangely quiet, even after a launch day patch that claims to adjust the sound levels. It feels like it's missing music or some more ambient battlefield noise. While we're talking about audio, it's worth noting that most of the original voice actors do not reprise their roles here. The graphics are often decent, but the stilted, awkward character movement just makes the action look strange.<\\/p><p>The game is also plagued with a handful of technical issues. Multiplayer matches are often hard to connect to, and if you're connecting to what <a data-ref-id=\\\"3010-313\\\" href=\\\"\\/sony-computer-entertainment-america\\/3010-313\\/\\\" slug=\\\"sony-computer-entertainment-america\\\">Sony<\\/a> refers to as a \\\"Type 3\\\" NAT, attempting to select the multiplayer menu at all simply pops up an \\\"Insufficient NAT\\\" message, preventing you from playing the multiplayer mode at all. Menus sometimes seem to freeze up for seconds at a time, preventing you from making a selection and moving forward. Joining multiplayer games often sends you back to the main menu instead of into a game. And the game can get caught in some sort of loop that causes it to pop up a wireless network error message over the single-player action without actually pausing the action. The game's already seen one patch, which put in an Ad Hoc multiplayer mode, but it's in need of more.<\\/p><p>So it's a bad game on its own, but the technical issues really twist the knife already buried in Declassified's dark heart. Allow me to remind you that this game is $50. Do not buy this game for $50.<\\/p>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-38542\\/\",\"id\":38542,\"name\":\"Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/call-of-duty-black-ops-declassified\\/3030-38542\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-544\",\"id\":544,\"publish_date\":\"2012-11-14 12:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-121100\\/\",\"id\":121100,\"name\":\"Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified\"},\"reviewer\":\"Jeff\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/call-of-duty-black-ops-declassified-review\\/1900-544\\/\",\"platforms\":\"PlayStation Vita\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-502\\/\",\"deck\":\"If this is the best Kinect can do with a \\\"hardcore\\\" game, you should just pack it up and wait for the next Xbox.\",\"description\":\"<figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/13\\/135472\\/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2175045\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.56484375\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.5%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/13\\/135472\\/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2175045\\\"><img alt=\\\"This is the most you'll be able to see of any one mission at a time.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/13\\/135472\\/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/13\\/135472\\/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/13\\/135472\\/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/13\\/135472\\/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>This is the most you'll be able to see of any one mission at a time.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p><a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-32695\\\" href=\\\"\\/steel-battalion-heavy-armor\\/3030-32695\\/\\\" slug=\\\"steel-battalion-heavy-armor\\\">Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor<\\/a> is thick with irony. It comes from a franchise that once hinged on dozens of buttons, yet this game offers almost no buttons at all. It's designed in such a way that only pixel-perfect aiming and split-second responsiveness will get you through its missions unscathed, but your ability to react quickly and take in your surroundings is so severely compromised that you'll die, repeatedly, in each attempt. It purports to put you right in the middle of piloting a lumbering, tank-like robot, while in reality it frequently destroys the tactile connection between player and game. Put as simply as possible, I don't think you should play Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor.<\\/p><p>The problem here is two-fold, split right down the middle between <a data-ref-id=\\\"3015-3249\\\" href=\\\"\\/kinect-support\\/3015-3249\\/\\\" slug=\\\"kinect-support\\\">Kinect<\\/a> functionality that barely functions, and game design that's equal parts boring and frustrating as all hell. The idea of placing you in the cockpit of a realistic battle machine has been done effectively for years on the PC, recreating everything from <a data-ref-id=\\\"3055-828\\\" href=\\\"\\/submarine\\/3055-828\\/\\\" slug=\\\"submarine\\\">submarines<\\/a> to <a data-ref-id=\\\"3015-438\\\" href=\\\"\\/tank\\/3015-438\\/\\\" slug=\\\"tank\\\">tanks<\\/a> to <a data-ref-id=\\\"3055-675\\\" href=\\\"\\/tie-fighter\\/3055-675\\/\\\" slug=\\\"tie-fighter\\\">TIE Fighters<\\/a> and believably putting you in charge of those vehicles' complex arrays of instrumentation. So the very basic, simulation-style premise of Heavy Armor is a sound one. It was the point during development that someone decided nearly all of your walking tank's vital functions--from changing ammunition to viewing a map to pulling down a periscope or closing a front shield vital to protecting your pilot--should be mapped to the imprecise, unreliable Kinect controls that this game went horribly off the rails. I won't go on ad nauseam about all the specific ways the Kinect can misinterpret your inputs and confuse one intended action for another, but it makes this game look utterly ridiculous to anyone watching you from the sidelines, as you flail in vain to do one thing and watch something completely different happen instead.<\\/p><p>It's frustrating enough to play a game that flat-out refuses to behave properly, but in Steel Battalion's life-or-death situations, it's absolutely unforgivable that you can't always do exactly what you want to do when you want to do it. This is the sort of game where you peer through a tiny viewport that shows you only a small portion of the battlefield directly in front of you, but you can and do take fire from all sides almost constantly. It's the sort of game where moving your <a data-ref-id=\\\"3055-21\\\" href=\\\"\\/mech\\/3055-21\\/\\\" slug=\\\"mech\\\">mech<\\/a> (called here a \\\"vertical tank,\\\" or VT) even a few steps will cause your reticle to bob up and down wildly, making it a delicate balancing act of deciding when to move and when to shoot. You can take critical damage from an enemy VT too far away to see, or a lone foot soldier with an RPG who fires before you can even swivel your turret around and pick him out from the background, and the game is merciless about disabling aspects of your VT like the viewport or, you know, the legs, rendering you blind or inert until you finish the mission or die. (You always die.) I've rarely felt so powerless to tackle a game's challenges as I have while playing this one, and that's not fun, at all.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/80630\\/1862711-steelbattalion_capcom_screenshots_embargoaugust16gmt0900_batch2_2.png\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1862711\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/80630\\/1862711-steelbattalion_capcom_screenshots_embargoaugust16gmt0900_batch2_2.png\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1862711\\\"><img alt=\\\"What's that, you wanted to close the shutter?

Too bad, here's a useless map!<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>It would be easy to blame the failure of this game entirely on the unreliability of Kinect, but Steel Battalion wouldn't even be a good game of this style even if it worked properly. <i>All<\\/i> of the difficulty comes from how slowly you move around the environment and how limited your ability is to identify the threats around you and defend yourself from them. Enemy AI is virtually nonexistent in this game; the infantry stands there motionless and takes pot shots at you even when you're right up in their faces, ready to step on them, and enemy VTs act pretty much the same way aside from mindlessly sidling back and forth occasionally. If anything about your own VT were faster or more precise, you would steamroll over every bit of opposition in this game. The mission design is bland as hell, usually tasking you with merely killing everything in an area, killing as much as you can until the time runs out, or getting to a specific point on the map. Many of the levels are bafflingly short, often involving only a few seconds of meaningful combat in between the embarrassingly stereotypical characters jabbering in your ear. It's also laughable how often your success in a mission hinges on performing some character action with motion control. The first time you fail to fight off an enemy assailant or grab an important object because the Kinect can't read your frantically outstretched arm, and consequently fail a mission because of it, is likely the last time you'll ever want to play this game.<\\/p><p>Because I haven't quite let go of the compulsion to run down all of a game's major features in a review, I'll mention that a few of the missions are playable with up to three other people, if you're one who believes misery loves company. If you get a high enough rank on these missions, you can unlock some minor upgrades (a night-vision periscope and a better map, for example) to equip on your VT. It's fitting that when you play these missions solo, there are AI players in there who can actually earn negative points when they perform badly (which they always seem to do), which drags down your overall score and makes it a lot harder to earn any new gear.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2175040\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2175040\\\"><img alt=\\\"You and me both, buddy.\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg 480w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"You and me both, buddy.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/13\\/135472\\/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>You and me both, buddy.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>To be clear, I take no pleasure in delivering this sort of bad news. Prior to the game's release, it was fun to see how earnestly Heavy Armor embraced what is honestly a pretty silly concept, but one that would be easy to get excited about if it worked right. Moreover, this is a great-looking game in pure aesthetic terms, with some really nice-looking battlefields and environment effects. I love the emphasis on a style of down-and-dirty, purely mechanical warfare clearly inspired by <a data-ref-id=\\\"3015-471\\\" href=\\\"\\/world-war-ii\\/3015-471\\/\\\" slug=\\\"world-war-ii\\\">World War II<\\/a>, back before the fly-by-wire computerization of vehicle control largely automated the process of driving these sorts of war machines. In the game's world, this future reliance on gears and grease follows a catastrophic event called \\\"Datacide,\\\" which seems to have destroyed all the advanced micro-electronics in the world and also coincidentally turned <a data-ref-id=\\\"3035-343\\\" href=\\\"\\/china\\/3035-343\\/\\\" slug=\\\"china\\\">China<\\/a> into an imperialist superpower bent on subjugating the rest of the world under the banner of a new United Nations. The game doesn't even do anything interesting with that setup, though, failing to establish memorable characters or create any intrigue between missions. The best you get are some vague allusions to a VT superweapon, but I was often eager to skip the cutscenes and get to the next mission, which, now that I think about it, really says something about the story.<\\/p><p>Maybe the latter half of Steel Battalion rivals the work of Shakespeare.

Even the worst games often have the potential somewhere within them to eventually do something cool (even if they rarely ever make good on that potential), and it's always struck me as unfair to judge a game until you've seen at least a taste of everything it has to offer. It takes a special kind of haphazardly designed junk to get me to throw down my controller out of frustration and outright hatred, and South Park: Tenorman's Revenge is such a game. Unless the endgame of Tenorman's Revenge suddenly repairs its busted controls, atrociously laggy netcode, and straight-up awful level design, I have a hard time imagining anything positive coming out of whatever chunk of this game remained untested by my hands.<\\/p><p>I'm not sure why it's so remarkably difficult to turn <i>South Park<\\/i> into a playable game. Other developers have tried and failed many times over, though Tenorman's Revenge deserves a special place in Hell for its outright butchering of the material. Things start out promisingly enough, with an opening preamble from an elder of the hyper-intelligent sea otters featured in the \\\"Go God Go\\\" episode describing <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-5484\\\" href=\\\"\\/eric-cartman\\/3005-5484\\/\\\" slug=\\\"eric-cartman\\\">Eric Cartman's<\\/a> sort of epic battle with noted ginger and accidental cannibal Scott Tenorman. Through this animated intro, we learn of Tenorman's plot for revenge, which includes stealing Cartman's Xbox 360 hard drive, and also unleashing hordes of ginger-haired robots on the world. The animation of this stuff immediately pops out as a positive point, doing a fine job of emulating the look and feel of the show. Unfortunately, that's the only thing developer <a data-ref-id=\\\"3010-6697\\\" href=\\\"\\/other-ocean-interactive\\/3010-6697\\/\\\" slug=\\\"other-ocean-interactive\\\">Other Ocean Interactive<\\/a> got right.<\\/p><p>Tenorman's Revenge is not funny. Not even a little bit. Even the worst licensed games usually find some way to tap into the core appeal of what people like about the thing that's been licensed, but the way Tenorman's Revenge tries to emulate <i>South Park's<\\/i> sense of humor is by mailing it in with a bunch of lazily tossed together references. Hey, remember Mr. Hankey? Manbearpig? Towelie? They're all there, and you're supposed to laugh at them...um, being there? I guess? I can only assume this because there aren't any jokes here. Sometimes Cartman says something about Kenny's poor family. Sometimes Cartman makes a crack about Jews. Sometimes Cartman says \\\"motherfucker.\\\" These are the things that you're theoretically supposed to chuckle at, but you don't, because they're not funny. They're badly timed, completely lazy, and frankly so overly familiar that you can't help but wonder if the developers wrote this script purely based on whatever <i>South Park<\\/i> clips have the most hits on YouTube.<\\/p><p>Without a solid story to care about or at least jokes to laugh at, Tenorman's Revenge is forced to rely on its gameplay to hook players in. This is borderline tragic for a couple of reasons. First off, this is a platformer in which the jump button does not work properly. Yes, it does make you jump, but it does so with just the slightest hint of delay, and features such floaty, bizarre physics that it's damn near impossible to land on any platform that's even a little bit awkwardly placed without multiple tries. I could see this being acceptable if Tenorman's Revenge were a relatively straightforward, no-frills platformer that mostly involved running to the right and occasionally jumping on bad guys, but this is not the case. If anything, Tenorman's Revenge is a convoluted nightmare of alternate paths, constantly moving platforms, endless collectables, and gobs and gobs of bad guys that like to spawn right on top of your head.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/87790\\/2163518-screenlg3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2163518\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.562\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/87790\\/2163518-screenlg3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2163518\\\"><img alt=\\\"...but badly designed levels, shoddy controls, and a ludicrously awful campaign progression kill this game dead.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/8\\/87790\\/2163518-screenlg3.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/87790\\/2163518-screenlg3.jpg 1000w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/8\\/87790\\/2163518-screenlg3.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/8\\/87790\\/2163518-screenlg3.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>...but badly designed levels, shoddy controls, and a ludicrously awful campaign progression kill this game dead.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>I'm not really sure what Other Ocean was going for here. There are glimmers of other classic platformers from the 8- and 16 bit eras here, so one can surmise that the idea here was to craft something that felt \\\"old school\\\" challenging. A delightful notion, except for the fact that the best games of that era demanded perfection while also providing you controls that felt correct for the challenges at hand. The lackluster control mechanics of Tenorman's Revenge aren't merely inadequate, they work <i>aggressively against you<\\/i>. And then you have all these ginger robots to contend with. They're not overly difficult on their own, but they're hardly ever on their own. The game tosses piles of them (again, sometimes directly over top of your head) and expects you to somehow balance jumping on their heads over and over again without accidentally landing somewhere close to another one without getting hit. Fun fact: that never happens. The best bet is to use one of the few random weapons often floating around the world, though that gets pretty dull pretty fast.<\\/p><p>Instead, whatever character you choose is beaten, pummeled, dunked in acid, dunked in human pee, and whatever the hell else over and over again until you just can't take it anymore. What makes it even more insulting is that the boss fights that come after all this abuse and torment are insipidly easy. Every boss I ran into operated on lazy, easy-to-recognize patterns and required only a modicum of effort to defeat. All that effort for so little payoff is just brutal on top of brutal. It's like surviving horrible trial after horrible trial just to survive, and then finding out all you have to do is kick a handicapped person in the shins to move forward.<\\/p><p>That is, of course, assuming you've collected enough time cores to do so. Time cores are the game's currency for progress. If you collect enough, you can just move straight on to the next stage. If you haven't, you're stuck going back and replaying earlier levels until you have enough. The issue isn't really that lack of exploration ensures you won't find enough of them. In fact, you can explore all you want, but if you're playing solo, or frankly with anything less than four total players, you're hosed, because several cores in every level are hidden behind character-specific sections. You see, each character has a couple of unique abilities that let them do things like bust through walls (via Cartman's stomach) or jump really high, because apparently <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-5680\\\" href=\\\"\\/kenny-mccormick\\/3005-5680\\/\\\" slug=\\\"kenny-mccormick\\\">Kenny<\\/a> can do that. There are also bits that allow specific characters to turn into the superhero versions of themselves (The Coon, Mysterion, and so forth). Again, if you are playing solo, that means you will have to play through multiple levels multiple times as at least two or three different kids in order to collect more time cores.<\\/p><p>So, here's the thing about this. This is always a terrible design decision. <i>Always.<\\/i> I don't care how good your core gameplay is. If you have to force players to go back through your game multiple times over just to get to the later levels, you have fucked things up beyond any measure of repair. It's fairly obvious that Other Ocean paid no real mind to the notion that people would roll through Tenorman's Revenge with less than three friends at all times. The co-op has no easy drop-in\\/drop-out functionality, and playing solo ensures that you'll have to repeat levels a minimum of two more times just to get enough time cores to succeed. It's even worse because often the cores are hidden behind a 30 second side-section of a level that you haven't seen before, ensuring that 99% of what you're slogging through is something you've already done (and probably hated) before.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/87790\\/2163517-screenlg2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2163517\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.562\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/8\\/87790\\/2163517-screenlg2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-2163517\\\"><img alt=\\\"Good games inspire you to go back and play them again because they're fun.

Online, the netcode is a disaster. Players seemed to randomly drop in and out, and lag made the already unwieldy jumping controls about a thousand times worse. Offline co-op negates the lag, but it still suffers from the other fundamental issue: the camera. The developers tried to rectify the absurd amount of zoom required to fit all characters on screen by having players off-camera for too long respawn next to whoever is further along, but it's only half a fix. The camera still zooms out way too much, and does so in kind of a chuggy way that sometimes leaves your character and the pit\\/enemy\\/laser beam\\/whatever else in front of them totally obscured. It's a recipe for accidental death in a game that's already an accidental death smorgasbord.<\\/p><p>Maybe my inability to soldier on through this half-busted garbage to its laborious conclusion puts an asterisk on this review for you. I don't mind, because I'm comfortable with my decision to abandon this thing in favor of doing literally anything else with my time. I'm comfortable with the notion that a game can be so fundamentally busted that there is no point in continuing on past the point of peak frustration. I'm comfortable in saying that South Park: Tenorman's Revenge is a gigantic middle-finger extended in the direction of anyone who might actually want to enjoy a game featuring the myriad memorable characters and storylines of <i>South Park<\\/i> in video game form. And because of all of that, I'm completely comfortable declaring that you should stay the hell away from South Park: Tenorman's Revenge.<\\/p>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-36686\\/\",\"id\":36686,\"name\":\"South Park: Tenorman's Revenge\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/south-park-tenormans-revenge\\/3030-36686\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-485\",\"id\":485,\"publish_date\":\"2012-04-04 12:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-114171\\/\",\"id\":114171,\"name\":\"South Park: Tenorman's Revenge\"},\"reviewer\":\"Alex\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/south-park-tenormans-revenge-review\\/1900-485\\/\",\"platforms\":\"Xbox 360 Games Store\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-455\\/\",\"deck\":\"This game is practically a war crime.\",\"description\":\"<p>While I am sure there are some out there who view the idea of private military corporations as a necessary evil in America's war on terror, I doubt too many of them even have particularly fond feelings toward the company formerly known as Blackwater.

When they aren't smuggling guns to the King of Jordan or getting sued by dozens of Iraqi families for \\\"random killings,\\\" they're helping out the U.N., rescuing formerly deposed peaceful leaders of fictional North African countries, taking down brutal military dictatorships, rescuing hostages and killing the same five recycled models of generic terrorists for about 90 minutes at a time.<\\/p><p>Blackwater feels, for all intents and purposes, like a public relations blast. It's less a video game than an attempt to try and sway the public opinion (at least insofar as the public opinion relates to gamers) back to their side, presenting them as a bunch of selfless, good-natured totally-not-mercenaries who save hostages and deliver food and totally don't kill civilians. How could they, when there are literally no civilians anywhere in this game? It's like they took a one way ticket straight to terrorist town.<\\/p><p>As a PR tool, Blackwater is rather vile, not to mention woefully ineffective. It stages life as a Blackwater contractor as something akin to being in the fucking A-Team, minus any of the dramatic flair or clever wit.

This is an on-rails light gun game without the light gun. Light gun games are not \\\"real first-person shooters,\\\" at least as I understand the definition. They're target shoots where the targets shoot back. This game has more in common with <a href=\\\"\\/time-crisis\\/3030-15867\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-15867\\\">Time Crisis<\\/a> or <a href=\\\"\\/hogans-alley\\/3030-6490\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-6490\\\">Hogan's Alley<\\/a> than it does <a href=\\\"\\/modern-warfare\\/3025-1258\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3025-1258\\\">Modern Warfare<\\/a> or <a href=\\\"\\/battlefield\\/3025-51\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3025-51\\\">Battlefield<\\/a>, and it's not even as good as Hogan's Alley.<\\/p><p>For one thing, the aiming is terrible whether you're using Kinect or not. With Kinect, you're theoretically supposed to aim your hand like it's a gun, and effectively live out a way more boring version of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=3ZcNXe20dXI\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">this<\\/a>. Except that's really tiring after a while, and also patently unnecessary. You can just lift your hand up a bit so it recognizes that your arms are there, and then you're fine. It's like you're shooting bullets out of your palms, but whatever. The bigger issue is that the aiming reticle is jittery and also slow as hell. It takes seconds (as in plural) to move the reticle from one side of the screen to the other. It's even worse if you play with a controller, though maybe that should be of no surprise. No light gun game translates well to dual-analog sticks, but the fact that it still sucks with Kinect is pretty astounding.<\\/p><p>That's the least of Blackwater's gameplay sins. More atrocious are the enemies and level designs, which dart violently between stump-stupid and frustratingly harrowing. Roughly half the enemies in the game will dart out from cover and then just kind of stand there while blurting out lines that sound about a step away from <i>South Park's<\\/i> \\\"Durka Durka!\\\" terrorist dialogue. Forever. They will <i>never move<\\/i>. Only after you shoot every other enemy on screen will they bother to shoot, but they still won't move. As for the ones who do demonstrate cognitive ability, they're still usually pretty easy to blow away, except for a random few who are such crack shots that they can basically pick you off entirely in three shots. This is where cover presumably comes into play, except that the cover mechanics are largely broken. If you're standing right next to a perfectly placed wall, then great, you can just hide behind it until your health regenerates. If you have to crouch, or bend in any sort of awkward way, most times the game has no idea what the hell you're trying to do, and just makes you stand there, soaking up bullets like they were glorious, life-giving sunlight.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/13692\\/1807458-highres_screenshot_00019.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1807458\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/13692\\/1807458-highres_screenshot_00019.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1807458\\\"><img alt=\\\"If you buy Blackwater, the terrorists don't win.

Granted, most levels last between 5-7 minutes, but that's still a decent chunk of content you're going to be repeating again and again, until you either figure out which enemy is randomly really good at shooting you, or you quit in pure frustration. I'm not sure if it's an accidental bonus or something close to tragic, but ultimately you'll only be doing any of this for maybe 90 minutes total. The campaign is ludicrously short, which gives one the impression that this game may have been intended for arcades at one point in its development cycle. What to do when you finish that 90 minute campaign? You could replay the same godawful levels you just played for better scores, or you could try out the barely-stitched-on multiplayer component, though that would entail subjecting friends to this game's various unpleasantries. With friends like you, who needs private military contractors?<\\/p><p>All of this misery for $50 a pop. An hour and a half of busted-ass light gun shooting that barely masks the deplorable PR message underneath. In effect, buyers of Blackwater are paying for propaganda. They're handing over money to a shady group of alleged killers for the privilege of being told that these guys aren't shady or killers or anything to that effect. The only good news is that the message is altogether lost in a sea of half-baked gameplay, barely-functioning graphics, and horrible one-liners.

Imagine a game that makes every rookie mistake a beat-'em-up can make--lousy combat, braindead enemies, uninteresting characters, clunky cooperative play, miserable music--and then stop imagining it. Lucha Fury is all of that, and some other nonsense you wouldn't even normally think of.<\\/p><p>Perhaps the developers at <a data-ref-id=\\\"3010-7007\\\" href=\\\"\\/punchers-impact\\/3010-7007\\/\\\" slug=\\\"punchers-impact\\\">Punchers Impact<\\/a> were just so enamored with their concept of wacky luchadores beating up other wacky luchadores that nobody stopped to think about <i>why<\\/i> they were doing any of this. The sheer allure of colorfully silly men and women in ludicrous wrestling masks running around and punching each other was more than enough to set this whole thing in motion. Too bad it wasn't enough to actually create an even remotely enjoyable game.<\\/p><p>Lucha Fury grates right from the get-go, with a nonsensical opening cutscene that gives way to a combat system that immediately informs you that you've made a terrible purchase. Controls are sluggish, unresponsive, and further hobbled by sometimes glitchy animations that don't quite hit their mark. Not an issue, mind you, given that enemies are morons. The default dumbasses literally stand still and flail their arms at you. That's their on-purpose default attack. After that, yes, things become slightly more challenging, but it's usually easy enough to clear wide swaths of bad guys just by wandering up and hammering on the X button.<\\/p><p>There is an upgradable combo system in the game, but its purpose is elusive. With the exception of a few enemies who are best dispatched via a grapple attack or two, there are few reasons to ever worry about any of the extra moves. More often, you'll be too busy taking your hands off the attack buttons to jiggle the right control stick when you're stunned. Yes, you can't recover from a heavy attack unless you flail the right stick for several seconds. That's precisely as awkward and unnecessary as it sounds.<\\/p><p>Some beat-'em-ups can suffer troubled fighting mechanics if they offer up enough personality, or, at the very least, a few memorable boss fights. Lucha Fury has none of these things. There is a story of some fashion, and the characters are presumed to have personalities, but you will care none at all about these things. Despite colorful appearances and misshapen forms designed for maximum wacky factor, the on-screen action offers a shocking dearth of excitement. The bosses occasionally offer up a creative design or two, but the fights range between \\\"over in a couple of seconds\\\" and \\\"laboriously long and drawn out.\\\"<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/9\\/90792\\/1822130-l7.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1822130\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.562\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/9\\/90792\\/1822130-l7.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1822130\\\"><img alt=\\\"The visuals are sharp, but the action never, ever pops.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/9\\/90792\\/1822130-l7.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/9\\/90792\\/1822130-l7.jpg 1000w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/9\\/90792\\/1822130-l7.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/9\\/90792\\/1822130-l7.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>The visuals are sharp, but the action never, ever pops.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>You can't even play Lucha Fury with your friends online.

If you're the sort to force your friends to suffer through terrible games alongside you, you'll have to do it in the same space, and they won't be able to leave the game. Unless they just get up and leave, I guess.<\\/p><p>It's all quite a shame, because Punchers Impact at least made a game that looks pretty good.

I know it certainly made me question whether I had simply been viewing these games through rose-colored glasses all these years, and that in truth, all beat-'em-ups are really this terrible. Then I went and played Final Fight again, and was reassured that no, old beat-'em-ups are fine.

This is a multiplayer-bereft game of video game football. The only witness to your theoretical digital gridiron glory will be mindless AI players, who frankly could not give a flip about how awesome that deep pass was, or how badly you smoked them on that killer interception. What awaits you is not the heat of intense competition, but the icy, soulless embrace of computer opponents who bend and react with all the humanity of a game of electric football. How pathetic is this? The <a href=\\\"\\/iphone\\/3045-96\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3045-96\\\">iPhone<\\/a> version, which is less than a quarter of the cost of the version found on this new-fangled device, has multiplayer capabilities. Chew on that one, and tell me it isn't a little salty.<\\/p><p>Mind you, multiplayer is not the only thing missing from Madden NFL Football. For starters, there is the obvious year marking in the title, which seems to suggest that this is an iteration of Madden that exists outside of time as we perceive it. Considering what an insane regression this is from what players got to know on the DS of old, credence is lent to that theory. The game offers up 11-on-11 and 5-on-5 permutations of football. In the 5-on-5 game, you play to a score of 30, and the incongruous soundtrack plays incessantly over the action. Otherwise, there is little difference beyond fewer player models on the field. <\\/p><p>In either event, you can opt for quick matches against the computer, or play in the season mode. That's not a franchise mode, mind you. It's a season mode. You play a season. That's it. Feature wise, it's actually a little like the online franchise mode introduced to the console versions not terribly long ago. Except there are no other people playing besides yourself, and the computer is seemingly incapable of trades, because that's probably hard to program, or something.<\\/p><p>That is the gamut of modes to run through. When you tire of playing through single season after single season, perhaps you can create your own metagame out of \\\"how many scoring exploits can I find in this game?\\\" Handheld versions of Madden have never been the shining beacons of quality of the franchise, but over the years, whatever short-straw-drawing developers EA happened to lock in a supply closet for the duration necessary to churn out the latest DS and PSP editions of the game clearly developed some kind of Stockholm Syndrome, and out of sympathy for their captors, began turning in progressively more playable--if not exactly impressive--handheld football games. Some included multiplayer, even.<\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/1746799-madden2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1746799\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.6\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:60.0%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/39\\/1746799-madden2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1746799\\\"><img alt=\\\" In six months, when Madden NFL 12 is released, feel free to just set your old Madden cart on fire.

It'll be cathartic.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><p>While this Madden plays a generally functional game of football in some scenarios--specifically when tuned to the All Pro difficulty, and after half-an-hour or so spent fudging with the few available gameplay sliders--it's effectively broken outside of those specific scenarios. All Madden is, predictably, impossible, cheap, and annoying. The default Pro setting cannot be considered anything but an elaborate, jokey reference to <a href=\\\"\\/tecmo-bowl\\/3030-11229\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3030-11229\\\">Tecmo Bowl<\\/a>. Every running back capable of moderate speed can regularly punch in huge gains like the great, diagonal <a href=\\\"\\/bo-jackson\\/3040-91277\\/\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"3040-91277\\\">Bo Jackson<\\/a>. On kick returns, the touchdowns you <i>don't <\\/i>get are the anomaly. Run forward, then run sideways, then run forward again, and watch as opponents struggle mightily to catch up. I got 14 return touchdowns in a row before I finally found a kick returner slow enough to negate the exploit. He was a linebacker, by the way.<\\/p><p>But what of the 3D? Or, you know, the only possible remaining reason to buy this thing? It's OK. The primary functionality of the 3D is to take the UI overlays and make them stand out against the depth of the play field. So scores, game clock, and other display-related bric-a-brac are all up in your face, while the field remains mostly the same. There is a bit of visual depth to the field you wouldn't otherwise get, but its purpose is elusive. The on-field action does at least look reasonably decent, with player models receiving a bump in quality over previous DS iterations. It looks more like the old PSP games than anything else. Still, animations are as janky as ever, especially when two players happen to rub up against one another, and while it's admirable that EA was able to shoehorn the console versions' commentary track onto a 3DS cart, it also seems an entirely superfluous and mildly cruel inclusion, given the giant, gaping holes found elsewhere.<\\/p><p>Madden NFL Football on the 3DS is a senseless endeavor. Its sole purpose seems to be to exist as a Madden game on store shelves at a platform launch. It's a crass, vacant husk so lacking in personality or substance that it might as well just be called Football Video Game: IN 3D!!! It's the worst kind of opportunism at $40 a pop. The tragedy is that it will work. People will buy this, because it exists at the right moment. Perhaps EA will release the rest of this game--namely, the fun parts--as part of its next Madden suite. That would be little solace for those who purchased this dreck. They'll still be saddled with this worthless, untradeable lump sitting on their game shelf, like a benign inoperable tumor. <\\/p>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-34245\\/\",\"id\":34245,\"name\":\"Madden NFL Football\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/madden-nfl-football\\/3030-34245\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-374\",\"id\":374,\"publish_date\":\"2011-03-30 13:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-109253\\/\",\"id\":109253,\"name\":\"Madden NFL Football\"},\"reviewer\":\"Alex\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/madden-nfl-football-review\\/1900-374\\/\",\"platforms\":\"Nintendo 3DS\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-349\\/\",\"deck\":\"It's too little and far, far too late for this shoddy, low-rent rhythm game also-ran.\",\"description\":\"<figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396261-power_gig_1.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1396261\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.56242424242424\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396261-power_gig_1.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1396261\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\u00a0ROCK\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396261-power_gig_1.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396261-power_gig_1.jpg 3300w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/26\\/1396261-power_gig_1.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396261-power_gig_1.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>\\u00a0ROCK<\\/figcaption><\\/figure> <p>The timing could not be worse for <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-30328\\\" href=\\\"\\/powergig-rise-of-the-sixstring\\/3030-30328\\/\\\" slug=\\\"powergig-rise-of-the-sixstring\\\">PowerGig: Rise of the SixString<\\/a>.

Not a fundamentally bad idea. Problem is, PowerGig has the misfortune of going up against <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-27919\\\" href=\\\"\\/rock-band-3\\/3030-27919\\/\\\" slug=\\\"rock-band-3\\\">Rock Band 3<\\/a>--an already established and recognizable franchise--which effectively did the same thing, and did it way, way better. Actually, even if the competition weren't so fierce, PowerGig is a substandard product across the board. The story mode, the song selection, the presentation, the number of players it supports--everything about PowerGig feels awkward and listlessly realized, as though the developer was unaware that there were already two, fiercely competitive franchises chasing after the same customers.<br\\/> <br\\/>As it's one of the defining characteristics of PowerGig, let's talk about that guitar. The underlying notion that using an actual instrument can make the mock-and-roll experience feel more real seems sturdy enough, but PowerGig fails utterly to make good on this promise. Disregarding the three-quarters size and the chintzy plastic body for a moment, this is an actual, functional electric guitar. It feels cheap and it's a difficult instrument to keep in tune, but these facts aren't really material to this review, or the game. What is material, though, is that playing PowerGig with this guitar is uncomfortable as <i>hell<\\/i>, and the game itself never really capitalizes on the fact that you've got a real guitar in your hands to justify that discomfort.\\u00a0<br\\/> <br\\/><\\/p><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1396263\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.56242424242424\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1396263\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\u00a0AND\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg 3300w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/26\\/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396263-power_gig_2.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>\\u00a0AND<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>     By default, PowerGig is a five-button guitar game, not unlike what you'd expect from Rock Band or Guitar Hero, though it uses its own style of notation that's difficult enough to read that it kind of explains why <a data-ref-id=\\\"3010-78\\\" href=\\\"\\/activision\\/3010-78\\/\\\" slug=\\\"activision\\\">Activision<\\/a> would be willing to pay <a data-ref-id=\\\"3010-648\\\" href=\\\"\\/harmonix-music-systems-inc\\/3010-648\\/\\\" slug=\\\"harmonix-music-systems-inc\\\">Harmonix<\\/a> the licensing fee to use that familiar note highway. There is also a power chord mode, which expands on the complexity a bit by recognizing the individual strings and asking you to make some simple two-finger power chords. Even in this power chord mode, though, you're still limited to the five frets you use for standard play, and the game makes no pretense about any of this being useful for actually learning how to play guitar. I feel like this should be implicitly obvious, but in case it's not, you <i>cannot<\\/i> use the PowerGig guitar to access the pro mode functionality in Rock Band 3, not that that's a reasonable expectation.<br\\/> <br\\/> You can choose to play PowerGig with a standard Rock Band or Guitar Hero compatible controller, which is certainly a more comfortable, if less <i>authentic<\\/i>, experience. Even with a better controller, there's still the unique quirk of not being able to use those controllers' built-in tilt functionality to trigger PowerGig's version of star power or overdrive, instead requiring you to press the select button. As a baffling counterpoint that flies in the face of the authenticity that PowerGig's six-stringed controller seems to strive for, <a data-ref-id=\\\"3010-7010\\\" href=\\\"\\/seven45-studios\\/3010-7010\\/\\\" slug=\\\"seven45-studios\\\">Seven45 Studios<\\/a> has produced its own AirStrike drum kit that uses special drum sticks, and, I dunno, lasers I guess, to interpret your Metallica Drummer routine into actual gameplay. I won't even get into the fact that the bounce-back from striking <i>something<\\/i> is an integral part of the real drumming experience, because the rarity of the AirStrike drums means that I've never actually handled a set myself. As far as I can tell this hardware is being made available almost exclusively through the developer's website. Smartly, PowerGig supports the drum controller you probably already have in your home.<br\\/> <br\\/><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1396264\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1396264\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\u00a0ROLL!!!\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg 480w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"\\u00a0ROLL!!!\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/1396264-power_gig_3.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>\\u00a0ROLL!!!<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>     In addition to guitar and drum controllers, PowerGig has microphone support. But in another move that can only be characterized as deliberately befuddling, there's no discrete bass guitar part, limiting your band play to a three-piece. Before you can get to the sub-par plastic band action, though, you must first suffer PowerGig's weirdo fantasy story mode, which is corny and self-serious in equal measures, and spends way, way too much time exhaustively explaining the tribal power structure in this stupid, rock-inspired universe. Without a library of downloadable content to rely on, PowerGig really lives or dies by its on-disc track listing, which is 100 percent leftovers. There are some recognizable artists in the mix, including folks like Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews who have up to now been staunchly opposed to the whole plastic-band idea. I suppose it's only fitting that these luddites would end up hitching their wagons to this lame horse. But even when it's bands you've heard of, chances are the songs themselves aren't the ones you'd want.\\u00a0<br\\/> <br\\/>After some serious consideration, I cannot come up with a single good reason why someone would buy PowerGig: Rise of the SixString.

Attempting to make some sort of peripheral-based skateboarding game is a neat idea, and one that, if the peripheral were robust enough, could result in some sort of faux-skating experience that approximates the real thing in a way that's accessible to non-skaters without being completely offensive to anyone who's ever pulled an ollie. But everything about Tony Hawk: RIDE, from the game's structure to the skateboard hardware itself, is an absolute mess that feels incapable of pleasing anyone, regardless of his or her skill level.<br\\/> <br\\/> When your feet first touch the RIDE skateboard, it actually feels pretty good. It rocks back and forth a bit, and the curved nose and tail let you pop the front or back of the board into the air with ease. It also has four sensors, one on each side, which are primarily used when you want to tell the game that you're performing a grab move. It's sturdy, and feels solid under your feet without feeling stiff. Unfortunately, any goodwill built up by the look and feel of the board is thrown out the window as soon as you're finished calibrating it.<br\\/> <br\\/> The problem with the board is that it isn't great at translating your movements into the appropriate on-screen actions. For example, the two primary ways to pull tricks is to lift the nose of the board into the air, and then either tilt the board to one side or pivot the front of the board left or right. These are \\\"tilt\\\" and \\\"flick\\\" tricks, respectively. More often than not, performing flick motions resulted in tilt tricks. Getting through a challenge that requires a specific trick type feels like luck in a lot of cases. Also, the board feels like it loses its calibration over time, resulting in cases where popping the nose up into the air stops performing ollies. Other times, it's a case of sensitivity, with the board feeling like it's requiring different levels of pressure or height to trigger the tricks. With a peripheral like this, consistency is absolutely key to getting better at the game and learning from your mistakes. With hardware that's unable to provide that level of consistency from session to session, Tony Hawk: RIDE is already a total failure.<br\\/> <br\\/><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1165067\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.58407079646018\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:58.4%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1165067\\\"><img alt=\\\"You'll visit a handful of different cities, including New York, Barcelona, and Tokyo.\\u00a0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/3\\/33529\\/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg 565w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/3\\/33529\\/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>You'll visit a handful of different cities, including New York, Barcelona, and Tokyo.\\u00a0<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>But it's hard to tell if it's the fault of the hardware or the software, because the game built around said board is a mess. Tony Hawk: RIDE places you into a series of fairly confined environments and, though it does still have a \\\"free skate\\\" option to let you explore, the main goals are things like races and score challenges. The racing feels like something out of <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-3631\\\" href=\\\"\\/tony-hawks-downhill-jam\\/3030-3631\\/\\\" slug=\\\"tony-hawks-downhill-jam\\\">Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam<\\/a>, another misstep from the once-great franchise's past. The trick sections of the game are usually score-based, and most of the time it's easier to just flail around on the board to pull off random tricks than it is to carefully attempt specific motions.\\u00a0<br\\/>\\u00a0<br\\/>The other main street mode offers challenges, which are sections of the level where you're asked to perform specific motions on specific objects, like \\\"flick trick off of the ramp\\\" or \\\"5-0 grind this ledge.\\\" The more specific the tricks, the worse it gets. It also doesn't help that the game never really tells you how to perform specific tricks, so figuring out how to land in a 5-0 grind instead of a 50-50 feels like it's left to chance. In the event that you don't know enough about skateboarding to know what the heck a 5-0 grind is, you'll probably have to turn to a web browser and look up videos of said trick, then maybe you can figure out what the game might be asking you to do and attempt it from there. Also, the challenges require you to hit every trick in the challenge in one run. If you miss one, the challenge doesn't end and immediately restart. Instead, you'll keep skating until you hit the end of the challenge area and respawn. The lack of an instant restart--something that the Tony Hawk franchise has usually been pretty good about offering--makes this whole section of the game frustrating.<br\\/> <br\\/> There's also a vert mode, which is used when you're skating in half-pipes. For these levels, you'll rotate the board sideways and stand on it while facing the TV screen, but the basics don't change that much. If you're tilting when you leave the ramp, you'll probably spin. Or maybe your feet will accidentally trip one of the side sensors and you'll grab. Or maybe you'll reach down to deliberately perform a grab and nothing will happen. It's terrible.<br\\/> <br\\/> Tony Hawk: RIDE defaults to a mode called casual, where you only focus on performing tricks while the game steers for you. There are spots in the race and trick courses where you can select alternate paths, but for the most part, it's none of your concern. Riding along a set track and performing tricks might sound like the worst thing of all, but it's actually the most manageable way to play. Bumping from casual over to \\\"confident\\\" puts steering control in your power, which makes things much tougher. But considering the board can't even keep up with you on casual, asking it to keep track of your leaning to let you steer impedes the process even further.<br\\/> <br\\/><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1165059\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.62654867256637\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:62.7%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-1165059\\\"><img alt=\\\"When you find a gap, the game will transition to a different angle.\\u00a0\\\" src=\\\"data:image\\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\" class=\\\"js-lazy-load-image\\\" data-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\\\" data-srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg 565w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg 480w\\\"><noscript><img alt=\\\"When you find a gap, the game will transition to a different angle.\\u00a0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg 565w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/3\\/33529\\/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/noscript><\\/a><figcaption>When you find a gap, the game will transition to a different angle.\\u00a0<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>The game also has a party play mode, where groups of people can get together to discover just how unfun Tony Hawk: RIDE is in a variety of modes.

Obviously that's not enough to make Tony Hawk: RIDE feel like it's worth anything close to its $120 price tag. While the Tony Hawk franchise has been down on its luck lately, and was probably in need of a reboot as dramatic as this, the execution is such a miserable failure that it manages to splash even more mud on Tony Hawk's legacy.

Joe: The Rise of Cobra's story and fiction because of all the dopey liberties it takes with the G.I. Joe source material. But those are the same liberties taken with the film upon which this game is based. So it's not the game's fault that Destro talks with a Scottish accent or that the redesigned Cobra Commander looks awful. Unfortunately, the <i>game<\\/i> part of this licensed release is even worse. It's an awful shooter that requires no skill to play and manages to be almost completely impossible to enjoy, largely thanks to its atrocious camera. It looks and behaves like a bad downloadable game, yet still comes on a disc and sits on shelves with an asking price of $49.99. And though I haven't seen the film yet, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that even people who come away from the movie loving it still won't find any bright spots in this bad, bad shooter.<br\\/> <br\\/> The game puts you in the boots of several different members of <a data-ref-id=\\\"3025-223\\\" href=\\\"\\/gi-joe\\/3025-223\\/\\\" slug=\\\"gi-joe\\\"> G.I. Joe<\\/a> as they fight against a still-rising Cobra. You work through four different areas, each with several missions. Along the way you'll find dog-tags that give you the option to unlock more characters, each with a different weapon. You eventually get the ability to unlock a few different members of Cobra, as well. This doesn't make much sense from a story perspective, and the throwaway line of dialogue at the beginning of such a mission, where <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-9911\\\" href=\\\"\\/storm-shadow\\/3005-9911\\/\\\" slug=\\\"storm-shadow\\\"> Storm Shadow<\\/a> makes some crammed-in comment about tainting his soul or something by working with the Joes doesn't really do much to explain it. But you get the impression that no one was really interested in making it all make sense, instead focusing on getting as many different classic characters from the franchise in there as possible. That's noble, but the occasional bit of fan service doesn't make the gameplay any better.<br\\/> <br\\/> The Rise of Cobra is a third-person shooter that feels like a misguided mix of classic arcade games like <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-6850\\\" href=\\\"\\/commando\\/3030-6850\\/\\\" slug=\\\"commando\\\"> Commando<\\/a> and modern shooters like <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-12231\\\" href=\\\"\\/gears-of-war\\/3030-12231\\/\\\" slug=\\\"gears-of-war\\\"> Gears of War<\\/a>. The camera is pulled back and moves automatically, but it also has (offline only) co-op play and a cover mechanic. Weirdly enough, you heal much faster when behind cover, but most of the cover is destructible, so when you need it most, it's not going to be there long enough to make a difference. Instead, you're better off making use of the game's roll button, which lets you flip out of the way and dodge incoming fire. The game does all of the aiming for you, so a lot of the action is of the \\\"hold up on the analog stick while holding the fire button\\\" variety. This gets incredibly annoying when you're trying to shoot at a specific target, as the right stick that's supposed to let you select different targets doesn't work very well at all. If you have two enemies ahead of you and want to shoot one instead of the other, it can be frustratingly difficult to get the auto-aim to obey. Half the time, the auto-aim seems to lock onto some off-screen object--usually a helpless box that gives you points when shot--and shoot at it until it's dead while you flail around trying to get it to aim at something that's actually shooting back at you.<br\\/> <br\\/><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-927442\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-927442\\\"><img alt=\\\"You'll have to run up and punch shielded enemies.\\u00a0\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg 1920w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/0\\/26\\/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>You'll have to run up and punch shielded enemies.\\u00a0<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>On the game's default difficulty setting, there's very little difference between pass and fail. If you run out of health, your character goes down on one knee for a few seconds, then stands back up with full health. The only penalty is that you'll lose some of the points you've accumulated, resulting in a lower end-of-level ranking, which nets you fewer points to spend on unlocking additional characters. The higher difficulty settings add the possibility of failure and also have higher scoring multipliers, but adding some semblance of challenge to the proceedings doesn't really fix anything that's wrong with the game. It just means it'll take you more time to play a game you probably shouldn't be playing in the first place.<br\\/> <br\\/> In addition to the on-foot shooting, the game offers up a few vehicles and a satellite minigame where you blast ground troops with an orbital laser. While a break from the standard action is a good idea, the vehicle control is a mess. The laser minigame is decent, but that's also where I ran into an issue where the game wouldn't advance at the end of the minigame, leaving me stuck and forcing me to abort the mission and start over.<br\\/> <br\\/> But the occasional bug isn't what makes G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra a bad game. There's no one thing that you can point at here. Every little thing about it, from the bland presentation to the dead-simple gameplay, conspires to make the final product incredibly lame. It has the depth of a bad downloadable game with the price tag of a full-on retail release. It's the worst of both worlds.

I'm talking about the early, unforgiving days of the genre, when it was all about things like incessantly studying and memorizing enemy movement patterns; completely disabling your sense of disbelief as you \\\"hid\\\" in areas of vague shadow; and getting punished mercilessly every time you were detected. It's 2009; does that still sound like fun to you?<br\\/><br\\/> Even if you're in the minority of masochists who would answer \\\"yes\\\" to that question, I've got bad news: Velvet Assassin doesn't even execute those stale old mechanics, contrived as they are, with any degree of competency.<br\\/><br\\/> It's a shame the gameplay is such a mess, because Velvet Assassin at least finds a way to put a fairly original spin on the World War II setting. You're British secret operative <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-10487\\\" href=\\\"\\/violette-summer\\/3005-10487\\/\\\" slug=\\\"violette-summer\\\"> Violette Summer<\\/a>, going behind German lines to sabotage the Nazi war effort by blowing up fuel depots, disabling U-boats, helping out other allied spies, and so forth. Summer is based on real-life WWII operative <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Violette_Szabo\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"> Violette Szabo<\\/a>, and I initially found her pretty appealing for her relatively realistic proportions and general lack of the hypersexualization that makes a lot of video game heroines hard to take seriously. (OK, she appears in her undergarments when you activate the game's dreamy version of bullet time, but otherwise, she's a heck of a lot more tasteful than <a data-ref-id=\\\"3005-195\\\" href=\\\"\\/lara-croft\\/3005-195\\/\\\" slug=\\\"lara-croft\\\"> Lara Croft<\\/a>.)<br\\/><br\\/> At any rate, whatever goodwill I had toward the game evaporated when I started playing it, since the stealth mechanics range from boring to ludicrous to maddeningly frustrating. Like most stealth games, this one considers you \\\"visible\\\" or \\\"not visible\\\" depending on factors like whether you're crouching, and whether you're in the light or in what passes for shadows. A better stealth game would at least let you use cover and shadow to intelligently conceal yourself and react dynamically to enemy movements to slink around and achieve your objectives without being detected.<br\\/><br\\/> But Velvet Assassin's stealth is poorly designed and inconsistent to the point of absurdity. Sometimes guards will walk right by you as you dump a body half in and half out of shadow, like nothing's going on. More often, they'll spot you from far away when it seems like you ought to be properly hidden in the shadows. Other stealth games set in modern times give you high-tech doohickeys like radar and night vision to help you get a leg up on the AI, but here you're just expected to develop a sixth sense about who can see you and where you can safely hide. With very little feedback from the interface, environment, and enemies, that's extremely hard to do.<br\\/><br\\/> <figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/1403\\/557939-10504_48a46de307aa0.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-557939\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.55709779179811\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:55.7%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/1403\\/557939-10504_48a46de307aa0.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-557939\\\"><img alt=\\\"Think you're safely hidden?

Don't be so sure.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>It wouldn't be so bad if escape was easy or even possible, but the game's most damning issue is its utterly unforgiving stance on getting caught. The second any guard sees you, every enemy in the area opens fire on you, and seconds later you're dead, almost every single time. Since the checkpoints are spread pretty far apart and there are so many unpredictable ways to get caught, every mission degenerates into a repetitive series of retries as you try to learn exactly the right way to meticulously pick your way through every section of the level. It's a little like banging your head into a wall over and over till you finally bust through it; not my idea of fun.<br\\/><br\\/> There are plenty of other little issues that get in the way. It doesn't help that the game makes clumsy use of lighting and its color palette to communicate safe areas to the player. The only areas where you're truly hidden from the guards are literally almost pitch black on the screen, and since turning on your flashlight immediately draws attention and gets you killed, you often end up fumbling around blindly trying to sneak around or pull off a stealth kill without getting caught. And frankly, the number of completely pitch-black warehouses, offices, prisons, and depots in the Third Reich is sort of ridiculous from a believability standpoint. In this game's version of history, it seems like the Wehrmacht must have lost the war because it couldn't afford enough light bulbs.<br\\/><br\\/> Meanwhile, darkened areas that look like they would hide you in a normal stealth game might as well be broad daylight here, so there's nothing really intuitive about the stealth and hiding here. I also had some issues with collision detection, getting shot or spotted through walls and closed doors. Some guards would get hung up on level geometry in some places and then teleport halfway across a room a few seconds later. The list of flaws that make the game a chore to play is a mile long.<br\\/><br\\/> But it's not worth harping on all them. Velvet Assassin has a neat premise, but I knew before the second mission was over that I never wanted to play it again. It's just too repetitive, frustrating, and archaically designed to make it recommendable even to diehard stealth fans. The genre has evolved, and Velvet Assassin didn't keep up.\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20573\\/\",\"id\":20573,\"name\":\"Velvet Assassin\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/velvet-assassin\\/3030-20573\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-153\",\"id\":153,\"publish_date\":\"2009-05-15 17:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-82160\\/\",\"id\":82160,\"name\":\"Velvet Assassin\"},\"reviewer\":\"Brad\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/velvet-assassin-review\\/1900-153\\/\",\"platforms\":\"Xbox 360\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-134\\/\",\"deck\":\"Master of Illusion Express: Funny Face is only two dollars, but it's so incredibly thin that it feels more like a demo than something you should actually have to pay for.\",\"description\":\"<div><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3948\\/947792-i_179293.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-947792\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" data-ratio=\\\"1.5\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:150.0%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3948\\/947792-i_179293.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-947792\\\"><img alt=\\\"This face is all \\\"is thiiiiiis your card?!?!\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3948\\/947792-i_179293.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/3948\\/947792-i_179293.jpg 272w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\\\" data-width=\\\"272\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>This face is all \\\"is thiiiiiis your card?!?!\\\"<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>Master of Illusion Express: Funny Face is like a little demo of the 2007 DS release, <a data-ref-id=\\\"3030-22220\\\" href=\\\"\\/master-of-illusion\\/3030-22220\\/\\\" slug=\\\"master-of-illusion\\\">Master of Illusion<\\/a>.

You can play it cooperatively with up to four players, either locally or over Xbox Live, and I found this experience slightly more enjoyable, simply because misery loves company. It's rarely very difficult, providing you with a spacious time limit and numerous hints that you can cash in to find the more evasive items. Any difficulty usually comes from the fact that the art isn't quite HD-quality, and attempting to use your in-game magnifying glass just makes it look muddier. <br\\/><br\\/>Sometimes, though, the description of what I was looking for was unclear, which eventually lead to me just randomly clicking on stuff and hoping for the best. Maybe this speaks more about my own ignorance, but how am I supposed to discern between a bocce ball and, well, any other type of ball, ever? And since when is \\\"swift\\\" another name for a pterodactyl? Occasionally the game just makes inexplicable assumptions about the player's knowledge base. There's one location where you're asked to identify a number of \\\"changes\\\" in various pieces of presumably real-world art, though without providing any sense of what the pieces might've looked like before.<br\\/><br\\/>It's unsurprising that developer TikGames is primarily known for cell-phone games and casual Flash-type stuff, because that's exactly what Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos feels like. This is exactly the kind of simplistic, disposable, and completely charm-free junk that Microsoft shouldn't be clogging up Xbox Live Arcade with.\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-713\\/\",\"id\":713,\"name\":\"Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/interpol-the-trail-of-dr-chaos\\/3030-713\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-101\",\"id\":101,\"publish_date\":\"2009-01-09 15:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-80725\\/\",\"id\":80725,\"name\":\"Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos\"},\"reviewer\":\"Ryan\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/interpol-the-trail-of-dr-chaos-review\\/1900-101\\/\",\"platforms\":\"Xbox 360 Games Store\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-72\\/\",\"deck\":\"This poor clone of today's music games is especially sad when you consider Konami's rich history with the genre.\",\"description\":\"<div><figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/780266-rockrevpath.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-780266\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/780266-rockrevpath.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-780266\\\"><img alt=\\\"Konami started this gangster isht...\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/780266-rockrevpath.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/26\\/780266-rockrevpath.jpg 800w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/26\\/780266-rockrevpath.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>Konami started this gangster isht...<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>You can trace the modern era of the rhythm game back to RedOctane and Harmonix. The hardware guys and the software guys, respectively, teamed up to create Guitar Hero, the game that brought us into this new era. Now that they're both split onto opposite sides of the Guitar Hero\\/Rock Band divide, it's easy to forget that they used to be bros. That makes it even easier to forget that they essentially created Guitar Hero by building a better, Western version of Guitar Freaks, Konami's guitar game that predates this current rush of plastic instrument madness by years--but only made it to home consoles in Japan. So it's a little sad to see Konami's current music game release, Rock Revolution. Sure, they're the original masters of the form, but this new release looks like it was cranked out by some new jacks who didn't know any better.<\\/div><br\\/><div>If Rock Revolution was released in 2004 or 2005, it would have been revelatory. But by today's standards, it's way behind the curve. This is a three-player rhythm game that lets two players play guitar and bass while a third can play drums. The game is played in the now-typical rhythm game format, so you're rated on what sort of combo of properly hit notes you can string together as you play through the songs. Unlike the competition, Rock Revolution sticks to the flat, 2D presentation of the notes you need to hit, much like you'd find in the company's Dance Dance Revolution or other Bemani games. This looks kind of cheap, and also seems worse from a gameplay perspective, as you'll need to view the entire length of the screen to see what's coming up. A 3D \\\"highway\\\" where the notes come at you give you more information in less space.<\\/div><br\\/><div>There are over 40 songs in Rock Revolution, and they're all covers. The game doesn't even acknowledge the original artists, instead just using a list of song titles on the back of the box and in-game. So if you're trying to figure out who originally performed \\\"Sk8er Boi,\\\" the game doesn't make Avril Lavigne's name easy to find. Also, the quality of the covers in the game is almost universally awful, making the game sound like a deceptive Walmart compilation.<\\/div><br\\/><div>The game attempts to carve out its own niche by offering different challenges in the game's career, such as one that places \\\"poison\\\" notes on the tracks. If you play too many of the bad notes, you'll automatically lose. Another speeds up the note track as your multiplier increases. Another mode has you play a portion of a song twice, then asks you to play that same portion without it telling you which notes you need to hit. Overall, I found all of these additions to be incredibly annoying. You can skip a bunch of them and still proceed through the career.<\\/div><br\\/><div>There's also an online mode, which I've tried a couple of times now, but haven't run into anyone else playing it. The online modes are one-on-one versus, co-op, and band battle, which allows two groups to go at it. A studio mode lets you use the instruments to lay down your own tracks, though it doesn't seem like you can actually go back into the game and play these tracks, only listen to what you've recorded and add effects.<\\/div><br\\/><div>The game doesn't have its own guitars, leaving you free to use a compatible product. On the 360, we tested it out with Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour guitars with no issues. The game will have its own drum controller coming out in November, but a menu option lets you switch between the Rock Revolution drums and a standard five-trigger setup that's compatible with Rock Band kits.<\\/div><br\\/><div><figure data-align=\\\"left\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/11300\\/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-428695\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.5625\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.3%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/11300\\/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-428695\\\"><img alt=\\\"...and this the motherlovin' thanks they get?\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/11300\\/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/1\\/11300\\/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg 1280w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_super\\/1\\/11300\\/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg 960w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/1\\/11300\\/428695-rock_revolution_6.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>...and this the motherlovin' thanks they get?<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>The Rock Revolution drums feel overly complicated. They have six pads up top along with a kick pedal. The six pads feel like they were almost randomly slapped onto the rectangular box that houses the kit. While it might have more pads than the other kits, the positioning doesn't feel right. Some elevation between the different pads might have helped them make more sense when using them. Also, it's probably worth noting that bolts need to be hand-screwed into the frame to build these drums, which makes it harder to change heights for different players and gives you a small bag of parts that you'll have to store when it comes time to stash these in your closet.<\\/div><br\\/><div>I kept looking for something in Rock Revolution that would redeem it and justify its existence. It's $10 cheaper than the average 360 and PlayStation 3 release. But $50 is still probably $30 too much for a game that comes off as a low-budget title. If you're playing loud enough, the noise from your plastic instruments will drown out the poor quality of many of the game's covers? No, that doesn't really play, either. Instead of trying to wrap my mind around this troubling cash grab, I'm going to move on and do my best to forget about Rock Revolution. I recommend you do the same.<\\/div>\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-20635\\/\",\"id\":20635,\"name\":\"Rock Revolution\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/rock-revolution\\/3030-20635\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-72\",\"id\":72,\"publish_date\":\"2008-10-29 16:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-78146\\/\",\"id\":78146,\"name\":\"Rock Revolution\"},\"reviewer\":\"Jeff\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/rock-revolution-review\\/1900-72\\/\",\"platforms\":\"PlayStation 3, Xbox 360\"},{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/review\\/1900-44\\/\",\"deck\":\"A crappy gambling game that also doubles as a parable about the dangers of downloadable content.\",\"description\":\"<figure data-align=\\\"right\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"image\\\" data-img-src=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/2405\\/564587-1.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-564587\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-ratio=\\\"0.562\\\"><a class=\\\"fluid-height\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom:56.2%\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/static.giantbomb.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/2405\\/564587-1.jpg\\\" data-ref-id=\\\"1300-564587\\\"><img alt=\\\"Forsooth, it's just as confusing as actual craps.\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/2405\\/564587-1.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/original\\/0\\/2405\\/564587-1.jpg 500w, https:\\/\\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\\/uploads\\/scale_medium\\/0\\/2405\\/564587-1.jpg 480w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\\\" data-width=\\\"480\\\"><\\/a><figcaption>Forsooth, it's just as confusing as actual craps.<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>Fable II Pub Games is an Xbox Live Arcade game designed to give fans a head-start on their Fable II experience, and it is terrible. If this collection of imaginary gambling games is representative of the quality that can be expected from Fable II, the world of Albion is in a heap of trouble.<br\\/><br\\/>Pub Games presumes that you're already pretty jazzed up about about the pending release of Fable II, so much so that you'd be interested in playing some games of chance in order to earn some imaginary gold to spend on tabards or flagons of mead or condoms or whatever in Fable II. The games themselves are just Ren-Faire versions of familiar modern gambling games. Fortune's Tower is a blend between blackjack and solitaire, Keystone is a rejiggered version of craps, and Spinnerbox is literally just a slot machine with a different skin. If Fable II becomes a giant smash-hit, I would not be in the least bit surprised to see Fable II Spinnerbox machines in Laughlin, Nevada.<br\\/><br\\/>Played straight-up, Fable II Pub Games isn't a very good way to accrue gold. The risk\\/reward model is heavily slanted to the house's favor, and of the three games, Fortune's Tower is far and away the most engaging, simply because it's the only one where player input has much impact on the outcome of the game. With both Keystone and Spinnerbox, it's pure chance. A social multiplayer element might've improved Keystone, but Spinnerbox is only interesting to enthusiasts of pressing the A button. You'll unlock a few variants of these games as you play, and you can also compete in tournaments against the computer for the chance to win actual items to use in Fable II, and that's about it.<br\\/><br\\/>If that were all there was to say about Fable II Pub Games, I probably wouldn't have even bothered writing this review. Fortunately, as of this writing (nearly a week after the game's initial release) there is an incredible bug in Fortune's Tower that essentially turns it into Ye Olde ATM, making what little gameplay there was here irrelevant. I suppose we won't know the full extent of the impact this infinite-gold bug will have in the economy of Fable II until that game is on store shelves, but I can say that I'm curious to see what my ill-gotten 130,000 gold will get me.<br\\/><br\\/>So, in a sick sort of way, these Pub Games have accomplished their mission of increasing my personal investment in Fable II. Unfortunately, it has taken on a certain car-crash appeal that I'm mostly sure the developer did not intend. It's <em>slightly <\\/em>less offensive as a Fable II preorder bonus, but it comes nowhere near justifying its 800 point ($10) asking price.\",\"dlc\":null,\"dlc_name\":null,\"game\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/game\\/3030-22987\\/\",\"id\":22987,\"name\":\"Fable II Pub Games\",\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/fable-ii-pub-games\\/3030-22987\\/\"},\"guid\":\"1900-44\",\"id\":44,\"publish_date\":\"2008-08-18 16:00:00\",\"release\":{\"api_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/api\\/release\\/3050-75833\\/\",\"id\":75833,\"name\":\"Fable II Pub Games\"},\"reviewer\":\"Ryan\",\"score\":1,\"site_detail_url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.giantbomb.com\\/reviews\\/fable-ii-pub-games-review\\/1900-44\\/\",\"platforms\":\"Xbox 360 Games Store\"}],\"version\":\"1.0\"}",
